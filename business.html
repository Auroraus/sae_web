<P><STRONG>法国蓝色海岸边的别墅</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>售价360万美元（约合2300万元人民币)</STRONG></P>

<P>这座石头建造的别墅始建于16世纪，位于法国蔚蓝海岸(C&Ocirc;TE D’AZUR)起伏的群山中的普拉斯卡西尔村(Plascassier)附近。它带有四间卧室、四间全功能浴室、一间半功能浴室。</P>

<P>这片占地约4.9公顷的土地上长满橄榄树，它们结出的果实足以让当地一家橄榄工厂生产橄榄油。</P>

<P>这座庄园还带有柏树、柑橘树、锦鲤池塘、温室和一间一居室客用楼房，配有玻璃暖房、淋浴室和独立的洗脸台。一个65英尺长的游泳池被一堵低矮的石墙包围。从朝西的花园里可以看到日落和远处格拉斯镇(Grasse)的景色。</P>

<P>普拉斯卡西尔是一个人口2200人的村庄，传奇歌手艾迪特・皮雅芙(&Eacute;dith Piaf)1963年去世前就住在那里。巴勃罗・毕加索(Pablo Picasso)最后一个住所和工作室的所在地莫金斯(Mougins)离这里不到八千米。</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>Free Power From Freeways? China Is Testing Roads Paved With Solar Panels<BR>高速路上的免费电力？中国试铺太阳能公路</P>

<P>JINAN, China ― On a smoggy afternoon, huge log carriers and oil tankers thundered down a highway and hurtled around a curve at the bottom of a hill. Only a single, unreinforced guardrail stood between the traffic and a ravine.</P>

<P>中国济南――一个雾霾天的下午，运输木材的大货车和油罐车沿高速公路隆隆行驶，从一处山脚下的弯道呼啸而过。车流和一旁的山沟之间，只隔着一道没有加固的护栏。</P>

<P>The route could make for tough driving under any conditions. But experts are watching it for one feature in particular: The highway curve is paved with solar panels.</P>

<P>在任何天气情况下这段路都不好开。但专家们正在监测的是路面的一个具体部位：高速公路的弯道上铺设了太阳能电池板。</P>

<P>“If it can pass this test, it can fit all conditions,” said Li Wu, the chairman of Shandong Pavenergy, the company that made the plastic-covered solar panels that carpet the road. If his product fares well, it could have a major impact on the renewable energy sector, and on the driving experience, too.</P>

<P>“如果能通过这个路段的测试，就能适应各种条件，”山东光实能源有限公司董事长李武说，铺在路面上的那些覆盖塑料表层的太阳能板，就是这家公司生产的。如果他的产品运行良好，将对可再生能源领域产生重大影响，也会极大地影响驾驶体验。</P>

<P>The experiment is the latest sign of China’s desire to innovate in, and dominate, the increasingly lucrative and strategically important market for renewable energy. The country already produces three-quarters of the solar panels sold globally, and its wind-turbine manufacturing industry is also among the world’s largest.</P>

<P>可再生能源市场越来越有利可图，在战略上也日益重要，中国渴望该领域的创新和主导地位，高速公路上的试验就是这种渴望的又一表现。中国已经生产了全球销售的太阳能电池板的四分之三，其风力发电机制造业也是世界最大的。</P>

<P>The potential appeal of solar roads ― modified solar panels that are installed in place of asphalt ― is clear. Generating electricity from highways and streets, rather than in fields and deserts packed with solar panels, could conserve a lot of land. Those advantages are particularly important in a place like China, a heavily populated country where demand for energy has risen rapidly.</P>

<P>这种用改装太阳能电池板取代沥青铺在路面的太阳能公路，潜在吸引力是显而易见的。在高速公路和街道上发电，而不是铺满太阳能电池板的田野和沙漠，可以节约大量土地。在中国这个人口众多、能源需求迅速增长的国家，这些优势尤为重要。</P>

<P>Because roads run through and around cities, the electricity could be used practically next door to where it is generated. That means virtually no power would be lost in transmission, as can happen with projects in outlying locations. And the land is essentially free, because roads are needed anyway. Roads must be resurfaced every few years at great cost, so the installation of durable solar panels could reduce the price of maintenance.</P>

<P>因为城市内部和周边都有路，路上发的电能够就近使用。也就是说几乎不会有传输损耗，不像那些地处偏远的太阳能发电项目。而且用地基本免费，因为公路反正总是需要的。公路每隔几年必须重铺路面，花费不菲，安装耐用的太阳能电池板也许还能降低公路维护成本。</P>

<P>Solar roads could also change the driving experience. Electric heating strips can melt snow that falls on them. Light-emitting diodes embedded in the surface can provide illuminated signage to direct drivers to exits and alert them to construction and other traffic hazards.</P>

<P>太阳能公路也可能改变驾驶体验。电热条可以融化落在路面的雪。嵌在电池板表面的发光二极管可以显示发光标识，指导驾驶员驶下出口，提醒他们注意道路施工和其他交通危险。</P>

<P>Now, such roads are finally becoming viable. Prices have fallen drastically in recent years ― thanks in large part to soaring Chinese production, a solar panel costs a tenth of what it did a decade ago. Road builders in China even want to design solar roads that can wirelessly recharge electric cars running on them, emulating a recent American experiment.</P>

<P>现在这种公路终于切实可行了。近年来太阳能电池板的价格急剧下跌――主要归功于中国电池板的产量飙升，一块电池板的价钱仅为十年前的十分之一。中国的筑路企业甚至希望赶超美国最近进行的一项实验，设计出一种太阳能公路，能给路上行驶的电动汽车无线充电。</P>

<P>China’s leaders in solar road development are Pavenergy and Qilu Transportation. The two companies are working together here in Jinan, in Shandong Province, with Pavenergy making panels for Qilu, a large, state-owned highway construction and management company that operates the highway.</P>

<P>光实能源和齐鲁交通发展集团是中国太阳能公路发展的领先者。两家公司正在山东济南进行合作，光实能源为齐鲁交通这家大型国有高速公路建设及管理公司生产太阳能电池板。 </P>

<P>The surface of these panels, made of a complex polymer that resembles plastic, has slightly more friction than a conventional road surface, according to Zhang Hongchao, an engineering professor at Tongji University in Shanghai. Professor Zhang, who helped develop Pavenergy’s road surface, said that the friction could be adjusted as needed during the manufacturing process to ensure a level of tire grip equal to that of asphalt.</P>

<P>上海同济大学的交通运输工程学教授张宏超表示，太阳能电池板由类似塑料的复杂聚合物制成，表面摩擦力比传统路面略高。参与了光实能源电池板路面开发的张宏超说，制造过程中可以按需要调整表面摩擦力，确保这种路面的轮胎抓地力水平与沥青路面相同。</P>

<P>The location of the solar road here, on a long curve at the bottom of a hill, was not Pavenergy’s first choice. The site was chosen because of its proximity to an electricity substation, ensuring that it would be connected to the grid. China is adding solar and wind energy sites so fast across the country that power generation projects farther from substations sometimes face delays of years in getting connected.</P>

<P>进行试验的这条太阳能公路位于山脚下的一处长弯道，这并非光实公司的首选地点。选址于此是因为这里靠近一个变电站，确保了发电能够入网。中国正在全国各地新建太阳能和风能发电站，速度太快，以至一些远离变电站的发电项目有时需要推迟数年才能入网。</P>

<P>The main Western rival to Pavenergy and Qilu is Colas, a French road-building giant that has developed 25 experimental solar roads and parking lots, mostly in France but also in Canada, Japan and the United States. The biggest of Colas’s solar sites, a country road in Normandy that opened a year and a half ago, has only half the surface area of the new solar highway in Jinan. Colas has been leery of putting solar panels on high-speed roads like the Chinese highway because of safety concerns; Professor Zhang said the panels were completely safe.</P>

<P>光实能源和齐鲁交通主要的西方竞争对手是科拉(Colas)，这家法国公路建设巨头已经开发了25处实验性的太阳能公路及停车场，主要在法国，在加拿大、日本和美国也有。科拉最大的太阳能项目是一年半前在诺曼底投入使用的一条乡村公路，表面积只有济南新建太阳能公路的一半。出于安全顾虑，科拉一直不愿将太阳能电池板装在与中国这条公路类似的高速路上；张宏超说这些电池板非常安全。</P>

<P>Still, a litany of outstanding challenges means the wide deployment of solar roads is a long way off.</P>

<P>不过，一连串的难题表明太阳能公路距离大范围铺设还很遥远。</P>

<P>For one, they are less efficient than rooftop solar panels at converting the sun’s light into electricity. They lie flat, and are intermittently covered by vehicles, so solar panels on a road produce only around half the power that rooftop ones tilted toward the sun do.</P>

<P>首先，太阳能公路将阳光转换为电力的效率低于屋顶太阳能电池板。公路电池板是水平放置的，而且间歇性地被车辆遮挡，而屋顶电池板向太阳倾斜，因此前者生产的电能只有后者的大约一半。</P>

<P>Solar roads are also more expensive than asphalt. It costs about $120 a square meter, or about $11 a square foot, to resurface and repair an asphalt road each decade. By comparison, Pavenergy and Colas hope to be able to bring the cost of a solar road to $310 to $460 a square meter with mass production.</P>

<P>太阳能公路也比沥青路贵。每十年重新铺设和修复沥青路面，每平方米大约要花120美元。相比之下，光实能源和科拉期望在大规模生产时能把太阳能公路的成本拉低到每平方米310到460美元。</P>

<P>Panels on a highway would likely need to be replaced less often than asphalt, Professor Zhang said. And a solar road can produce about $15 a year worth of electricity from each square meter of solar panels. So it could roughly pay for itself, compared with asphalt, over about 15 years.</P>

<P>张宏超说，高速公路上的电池板的更换，可能不像沥青路面那么频繁。路上的电池板每平方米每年还能生产价值约15美元的电力。因此与沥青相比，电池板用上大约15年就能够抵销成本。</P>

<P>Less clear is whether the panels would be able to take the pounding of millions of tires each year for more than a decade, or whether they might be stolen.</P>

<P>但这些电池板能否承受连续十几年、每年几百万次的车轮碾压，或者是否会被偷走，就不那么好说了。</P>

<P>In the United States, installing solar roads is more complicated.</P>

<P>在美国，铺设太阳能公路就是一个更棘手的问题了。</P>

<P>With the exception of some bridges and sections of interstate highways, American roads tend to be built with a lot of asphalt, but with less concrete underneath than roads elsewhere, said Kara M. Kockelman, a transportation engineering professor at the University of Texas.</P>

<P>德克萨斯州大学交通工程教授卡拉・M・科克曼(Kara M. Kockelman)说，除了部分桥梁和州际高速公路的某些路段外，美国公路往往用大量沥青铺就，但路面下的混凝土比其他地方的公路用得少。</P>

<P>The problem with asphalt is that it compresses slightly under the weight of trucks. The blue silicon of solar cells, the panels’ electricity-generating component, can withstand being mashed by many tons of weight. But the nearly paper-thin cells snap when bent, like a thin sheet of sugar. (This is not as much of an issue in China, where highways are built with very thick concrete bases.)</P>

<P>沥青的问题是在卡车的重压下会轻微变形。太阳能电池的蓝色硅晶片，也就是电池板的发电部件，能够承受数吨的重压。但一遇弯折，纸一般薄的硅晶片就会像薄薄的糖片一样折断。（在中国，高速公路铺有很厚的混凝土路基，这就不是太大的问题。）</P>

<P>Still, executives here are hopeful. They say that the technology is ready and that they are not concerned even by the complications of American highway construction.</P>

<P>不过这里的企业高管们是满怀希望的。他们说技术已然完备，即使美国高速公路建设的情况复杂，他们也并不担心。</P>

<P>“If conditions permit,” Xu Chunfu, Qilu’s chairman, said, “I would like to build a solar road in the United States.”</P>

<P>“如果条件允许，”齐鲁交通发展集团的董事长徐春福说，“我还想到美国建一条光伏路。”</P>

<P>In Vancouver, a Housing Frenzy That Even Owners Want to End<BR>温哥华房价狂飙，但为何连房主都高兴不起来？</P>

<P>VANCOUVER, British Columbia ― Between multimillion-dollar tear-downs, blocks full of backyard cottages and towering condominiums that are sold and resold several times before they are even built, there is no shortage of anecdotes about this city’s housing frenzy.</P>

<P>不列颠哥伦比亚省温哥华――价值数百万美元的待拆房、满是后院小屋的街区，以及建成之前就已经被多次出售和转售的高耸公寓楼，这个城市一点也不缺少关于住房狂热的轶事。</P>

<P>Here is a new one: Vancouver is so expensive that politicians want to tax its real estate market into submission, and many homeowners ― who will lose money if home prices fall ― think it’s the best idea they’ve heard in years.</P>

<P>这里有一个新的：温哥华如此昂贵，以至于政客想通过征税来整顿房地产市场，很多房主――如果房价下跌，他们会损失财产――也认为，这是他们在很多年来听到的最好的主意。</P>

<P>“I would like to see a correction to sober up this whole place,” said Rob Welsh, a retired airplane mechanic who lives in a Vancouver suburb. Mr. Welsh bought his house in 2000 and has become a paper millionaire based on its appreciation. It makes him more anxious than happy.</P>

<P>住在温哥华郊区的退休飞机机械师罗布・韦尔斯(Rob Welsh)说：“我希望有一场纠正，让整个地方清醒过来。”他于2000年买了自己的房子，因为升值而成为了纸面上的百万富翁。比起快乐，这更让他感到焦虑。</P>

<P>“If I got to lose 200 or 300 grand to keep the kids and the future of this place, so be it,” he said.</P>

<P>“如果我得失去20万或30万美元来保护这个地方的孩子和它的未来，那就这样做吧，”他说。</P>

<P>Like many cities around the world, Vancouver is grappling with punishing housing costs that have pushed out large swaths of residents ― and are causing distress among young adults who can’t afford rent today and take it for granted that they will never own a home.</P>

<P>和世界各地的许多城市一样，温哥华也在努力应对把大量居民赶出市中心的高昂房价，它给那些如今无力支付房租、认为自己永远都不会拥有住房的年轻人带来了苦恼。</P>

<P>Part of the reason is the attraction of Vancouver itself, and not just among Canadians. Between its natural beauty, its temperate climate and Canada’s liberal immigration policies, the city has become a magnet for foreign buyers, especially from China.</P>

<P>造成这种情况的部分原因是温哥华本身的吸引力，而且不只加拿大人有这样的感受。由于自然美景、温和的气候和加拿大宽松的移民政策，这座城市已经成为吸引外国买家，尤其是中国买家的磁石。</P>

<P>Many places, in both Canada and the United States, have tried remedies to the squeeze: tenant protections, housing subsidies and steps to enable developers to build higher and faster so that more housing will come online. But few have gone as far as British Columbia.</P>

<P>在加拿大和美国的很多地方试图缓解住房紧张：保护租户、住房补贴，以及让开发商房子越建越高、越修越快，从而让更多的房子上线。但不列颠哥伦比亚省的做法无出其右。</P>

<P>Last year, in a provincial election almost entirely about housing costs, citizens voted out the center-right B.C. Liberal Party, which had run British Columbia for 16 years, and brought in a government led by the left-of-center B.C. New Democratic Party. Since then, the New Democrats have not only tried to increase the housing supply, but have also proposed a slew of measures that aim to curb housing demand and chase away overseas buyers.</P>

<P>去年，在一场几乎完全围绕住房成本的省级选举中，公民投票否决了领导不列颠哥伦比亚省16年的中间偏右的不列颠哥伦比亚自由党(B.C. Liberal Party)，让中间偏左的不列颠哥伦比亚新民主党(B.C. New Democratic Part)上台。自那时起，新民主党不仅试图提高住房供应量，还提出了一系列旨在抑制住房需求、驱赶外国买家的措施。</P>

<P>The New Democrats raised British Columbia’s foreign-buyer tax to 20 percent of a home’s purchase price, from 15 percent. (Ontario has a 15 percent tax.) In addition, the party plans to impose higher property taxes on second homes, on families whose primary breadwinner’s earnings come from money abroad and on homes valued at more than 3 million Canadian dollars ($2.3 million). Vancouver has passed a number of local measures, including a tax on empty homes.</P>

<P>新民主党把大不列颠哥伦比亚的外国买家税从房产价格的15%提高到了20%（安大略省的税率为15%）。此外，该党计划对第二套房，养家者的主要收入来自国外的家庭，以及价值超过300万加元的房产征收更高的房产税。温哥华当地通过了一系列措施，包括对空置房征税。</P>

<P>“There’s no question that many of the measures we are bringing in are bold, but we felt they were critical if we were really going to address this crisis,” Carole James, British Columbia’s finance minister, said in an interview.</P>

<P>“毫无疑问我们推出的很多措施都很大胆，但我们觉得如果真的要解决这场危机，它们是关键，”不列颠哥伦比亚省财政部长卡罗尔・詹姆斯(Carole James)在一次采访中说。</P>

<P>This would seem politically perilous. Two-thirds of Canadians own their homes, roughly the same share as in the United States. And Canadians, like Americans, expect to make money from the investment. Yet a number of polls, and interviews with homeowners like Mr. Welsh, suggest that Vancouverites are so shocked at the price levels that even homeowners want the market to cool.</P>

<P>这在政治上似乎是危险的。三分之二的加拿大人拥有自己的房子，与美国的比例大致相同。加拿大人和美国人一样，也希望从这项投资中获利。然而，一些民调和对上述的威尔斯等房主的采访表明，温哥华人对房价水平感到非常震惊，以至于房主也希望市场降温。</P>

<P>In 2016, the nonprofit Angus Reid Institute in Vancouver found that roughly two-thirds of residents in the metropolitan area wanted home prices to fall, including half of homeowners. More startling was that one in five homeowners in the survey expressed a desire to see home prices fall by 30 percent or more.</P>

<P>2016年，温哥华的非盈利组织安格斯・里德学院(Angus Reid Institute)发现，这个大都会地区几乎三分之二的居民希望房价下降，包括一半的房屋拥有者。更让人震惊的是，调查中有五分之一的房主表示，希望看到房价下跌30%甚至更多。</P>

<P>No doubt, many voters would think twice about that opinion if home prices actually crashed. Still, respondents “were clearly reacting from a place of deep anxiety, even desperation, about their own or their loved ones’ ability to access the housing market,” said Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid.</P>

<P>毫无疑问，如果房价真的暴跌，许多选民会重新考虑这个观点。尽管如此，受访者的反应“显然是由于他们对自己，乃至他们所关爱的人进入房市的能力存在深深的焦虑，甚至是绝望，”安格斯・里德执行董事沙奇・库尔(Shachi Kurl)说。</P>

<P>And so far, people like what they see from the new government’s attempts to rein in the market: In a separate Angus Reid poll this year, large majorities of British Columbians supported the housing measures proposed by the New Democratic government.</P>

<P>到目前为止，新政府控制房市的尝试是人们乐于见到的：在安格斯・里德今年的另一项调查中，大多数不列颠哥伦比亚省人支持新民主党政府提出的住房措施。</P>

<P>“Unbeknownst to many people in the local population, Vancouver has been sold as a subsidized resort town and retirement community to the world,” said Josh Gordon, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University here. “We are now seeing the culmination of that dynamic.”</P>

<P>“当地许多人并不知道，温哥华已经作为一个受资助的度假村和退休社区向全世界出售，”西蒙・弗雷泽大学(Simon Fraser University)政治学教授乔什・戈登(Josh Gordon)说。“我们正在目睹这种趋势的顶点。”</P>

<P>Vancouver, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and wide maritime views, has never been especially cheap. But home and condominium prices are up by close to 16 percent over the past year, and about 60 percent over the past three, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.</P>

<P>温哥华被白雪皑皑的山脉和广阔的海景包围，房价从未特别便宜。根据大温哥华区房地产委员会(Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver)的数据，过去一年，家庭和公寓住宅价格上涨近16%，过去三年上涨约60%。</P>

<P>What makes these gains so remarkable is that unlike Silicon Valley, London or New York ― where the presence of high-paying tech and finance jobs helps explain housing costs ― Vancouver has relatively low salaries. As part of their bid for Amazon’s second headquarters, Vancouver officials boasted about having “the lowest wages of all North American tech hubs.”</P>

<P>增长如此引人瞩目的原因在于，在硅谷、伦敦或纽约，高收入的科技和金融工作的出现有助于解释住房成本，而温哥华却不一样，这里的薪水相对较低。为了申请成为亚马逊第二总部，温哥华官员夸口说，“在全北美各大科技中心，这里的工资水平是最低的。”</P>

<P>“We have plenty of jobs, but you might need two or three of them to be able to afford a place to live,” said Andy Yan, director of the City Program at Simon Fraser.</P>

<P>“我们有很多工作，但你可能需要两三个人的工资才能负担得起住处，”西蒙・弗雷泽城市项目主管安迪・严(Andy Yan)说。</P>

<P>How much of the city’s housing demand is coming from China is hotly debated. Government statistics show that foreign buyers own about 5 percent of the housing stock in the metropolitan area, but the numbers are several times as high for new condominiums, which helps to explain why a surge of building hasn’t done much to reduce prices, according to an analysis by Mr. Yan. And this almost certainly underestimates the influence of foreign capital, since the data exclude Canadian immigrants with money from overseas.</P>

<P>该市的住房需求有多少是来自中国，这个问题引起了激烈辩论。政府统计数据显示，外国买家拥有城区住房存量的5%，但这个数字是新建公寓的数倍，根据安迪・严的分析，这有助于解释为什么这一波建造热潮对降低房价没有太大作用。而且这一数字几乎肯定低估了外资的影响，因为它不包括使用海外资金的加拿大移民。</P>

<P>The real estate industry contends that the issue is not an influx of Chinese, who have been coming to Vancouver for decades, but zoning restrictions that prioritize low-density living, outside of a few high-rise areas.</P>

<P>房地产业争辩说，问题不在于几十年来涌入温哥华的中国人，而是在于温哥华的的分区限制措施，它的首要目标是发展几处高楼区域之外的低密度生活区。</P>

<P>“I live 15 minutes from the downtown core in a house,” said Keith Roy, a real estate agent. “That’s crazy. I should be in a townhouse at this distance, maybe even a low-rise condo building.”</P>

<P>“我住在距市中心15分钟车程的一座独栋房子里，”房地产经纪人基思・罗伊(Keith Roy)说。“太疯狂了。在这种地段，我应该住的是联排别墅，甚至可能是低层共管公寓。”</P>

<P>The figures show, however, that unlike other expensive West Coast cities like San Francisco, where the housing supply has long lagged behind population growth, Vancouver has consistently produced new housing. Over the past decade, the housing stock has grown by about 12 percent, while the population has grown by about 9 percent, according to the city.</P>

<P>在旧金山等房价昂贵的西海岸城市，住房供应远远落后于人口增长，然而数据显示，温哥华一直在生产新住房。根据该市的数据，在过去十年中，住房储备增长了约12%，而人口增长了约9%。</P>

<P>This disparity has persuaded the city to broaden its measures beyond just a push for new buildings to efforts like the empty homes tax.</P>

<P>这种差距已经说服该市采取更多措施，而不仅仅是采取征收空置房屋税等推动新建筑投入使用的措施。</P>

<P>“It’s getting out of the mind-set that just more is better,” said Gil Kelley, the city’s general manager of planning, urban design and sustainability.</P>

<P>“人们不再认为多多益善，”温哥华规划、城市设计和可持续发展总经理吉尔・凯利(Gil Kelley)说。</P>

<P>Tom Davidoff, an economist at the University of British Columbia, said it was all of the above. Vancouver is popular with foreign buyers, yes. But it also has strict zoning laws that reserve most of the city’s land for single-family homes, as well as high income taxes but low property taxes of about a quarter of a percent of the property value.</P>

<P>不列颠哥伦比亚大学的经济学家汤姆・戴维杜夫(Tom Davidoff)说，以上都是房价高的原因。是的，温哥华很受外国买家欢迎。但它也有严格的分区法律，把城市大部分土地用做独户住宅，此外它的收入所得税很高，但物业税很低，仅占物业价值的四分之一左右。</P>

<P>“The message we have sent the world is, ‘Come and buy our real estate, but do not try to make a living here,’” Mr. Davidoff said. “Mission accomplished.”</P>

<P>“我们向全世界发出的信息是，‘来买我们的房地产，但不要在这里谋生，'”戴维杜夫说。“这个任务已经完成。”</P>

<P>While the new government’s housing measures are popular with many voters, richer homeowners are fuming. A recent stroll through Vancouver’s wealthier West Side turned up bright red signs protesting the tax on $3 million homes. “Are you angry yet?” read one. “Rally against the N.D.P. tax grab now.”</P>

<P>虽然新政府的住房措施受到众多选民的欢迎，但更富有的房主十分愤怒。最近在温哥华较富裕的西区散步时，可以看到鲜红色的标牌，抗议征收300万美元的房产税。“这下你愤怒了吗？”其中一个牌子上写着。还有“反对新民主党的税收掠夺。“</P>

<P>A group of wealthy homeowners also petitioned to get Mr. Davidoff, the economist, fired. His sin: talking favorably about increased property taxes.</P>

<P>一群富有的房主也发起请愿，要求解雇经济学家戴维杜夫。他的罪过就是支持增加财产税。</P>

<P>However it happened, Vancouver’s transformation to an international gateway has given the city something of an identity crisis. For Vancouverites who a generation ago took it for granted that they could buy a home or condo near the urban core, the trade-offs for the steep rise in prices are hard to accept.</P>

<P>不管发生了什么，温哥华向国际门户的转变给这座城市带来了身份危机。一个世代以前，温哥华人认为他们可以在市区中心附近购买住宅或公寓，对他们来说，房价急剧上涨的代价是难以接受的。</P>

<P>“People who live and work in Vancouver can’t afford to live here,” said Nathalie Baker, a lawyer who is in favor of measures to cool the market, even though she owns a home here. “And that is a very significant problem.”</P>

<P>尽管在温哥华拥有一栋房子，但律师娜塔莉・贝克尔(Nathalie Baker)依然赞同采取措施冷却市场。她说：“在温哥华生活和工作的人却不能居住在这里，这是一个非常严重的问题。”</P>

<P>China Ride-Hailing Giant Didi Revamps Service After Passenger Is Killed<BR>滴滴整改顺风车业务</P>

<P>BEIJING ― Didi Chuxing, China’s wildly popular ride-sharing service, said on Wednesday that it would overhaul its app and its safety and security practices, after reports that a passenger had been raped and killed by her driver.</P>

<P>北京――中国广受欢迎的共享出行服务滴滴出行周三表示，将整改其应用程序及安全和保障措施，此前有报道称一名乘客遭到司机奸杀。</P>

<P>The passenger, Li Mingzhu, 21, a flight attendant, was found dead last Saturday after hailing a ride downtown from the airport in the northern Chinese city of Zhengzhou on May 6, according to state media. Didi Chuxing has faced a widening array of complaints from female passengers in recent days, as nationwide attention has focused on the company in the aftermath of the killing.</P>

<P>该名乘客名叫李明珠，21岁，是一名空乘人员。据官方媒体报道，她5月6日从中国北部城市郑州机场叫车前往市中心，于上周六被发现死亡。近些天来，随着全国都在关注这起杀人事件后的滴滴出行，该公司面临越来越多的女性乘客投诉。</P>

<P>Didi Chuxing is similar to Uber, and indeed bought Uber’s business in China nearly two years ago. The Chinese company, which has been expanding at a breakneck pace within the country and around the world, says it has 450 million users. One of China’s most successful tech giants, it is expected to explore making a multibillion-dollar initial public offering this year.</P>

<P>滴滴出行与优步(Uber)类似，近两年前还买下了优步在中国的业务。这家一直在国内外迅速扩张的中国企业号称拥有4.5亿用户。作为中国最为成功的科技巨头之一，该公司预计将于今年进行估值数百亿美元的上市。</P>

<P>Within China, Didi Chuxing offers several options, including an individual ride-hailing service and a cheaper car-pooling service, called Didi Hitch, which Ms. Li had used. Both drivers and passengers typically upload photographs of themselves to user profiles. In the wake of the killing, Didi Hitch customers raised concerns about drivers’ ability to append notes about them, many of which proved to focus on women’s appearances.</P>

<P>在中国国内，滴滴出行提供多种选择，包括个人叫车服务及一种更为便宜、名为“滴滴顺风车”的拼车服务，李明珠使用的就是这项服务。司机和乘客通常都会在用户帐号上传自己的照片。在这起杀人案发生后，司机对乘客的评价功能引发了滴滴顺风车使用者的担忧，这些评价很多都跟女性外表有关。</P>

<P>Su Shiya, 21, a student in southern China, examined her Didi profile and found that drivers had tagged her as an “intellectual beauty” and a “sweetheart.”</P>

<P>21岁的苏诗雅是中国南部的一名学生，她检查了自己的滴滴帐号，发现司机给她打上了“知性美女”和“小可爱”的标签。</P>

<P>“These comments are open to all the Didi drivers,” she said. “They all know what I look like.” She said she found the comments chilling, and has since replaced her image with that of an animated dog.</P>

<P>“这些对所有顺风司机都可见，”她说。“都知道我长什么样子。”她说自己觉得这些评价令人毛骨悚然，后来她将自己的照片换成了一只卡通狗的图片。</P>

<P>Didi Chuxing suspended its Hitch service after the killing, and said on Wednesday that it would revamp the service. It said it would suspend the ability of drivers to leave personalized tags and ratings of passengers on Didi Hitch, and that all profile pictures of users would be replaced with a generic image.</P>

<P>杀人案发生后，滴滴出行暂停了顺风车服务，并且在周三表示将对该服务进行整改。该公司表示，不再让司机在滴滴顺风车上对乘客留下个性化标签和打分，并且说所有用户照片都将被一张通用图片替代。</P>

<P>Also, the Didi Hitch service will be suspended between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day, the company said, and drivers will be required to confirm their identities via facial recognition before each trip. Ms. Li was reportedly killed by a man using his father’s Didi driver account. Days later, the police said they had found the suspect’s body in a river in Zhengzhou.</P>

<P>此外，该公司还表示，滴滴顺风车服务将在每日晚上10点到早上6点间关停，并且司机将被要求在每次开始行程时通过面部识别确认身份。据报道，杀死李明珠的男子使用的是他父亲的滴滴帐号。数天后，警方表示他们在郑州的河中找到了嫌犯尸体。</P>

<P>Drivers for all of Didi Chuxing’s ride-hailing services will also be required to be vetted and go through a background check, the company added, promising that all the new measures would be in place by the end of the month.</P>

<P>该公司补充说，滴滴出行所有叫车服务的司机还将被要求接受审查，并且接受背景调查，承诺所有的新举措都将在本月底之前到位。</P>

<P>“We are deeply saddened by and sorry about the tragedy,” the company said in a statement. “We need to step up to win the trust of our users. Our responsibilities in this case are undeniable.”</P>

<P>“我们感到万分地悲痛与愧疚”，这家公司在一则声明中说。“作为平台我们辜负了用户的信任，在这件事情上，我们负有不可推卸的责任”。</P>

<P>Alibaba’s Profit Slips as It Spends to Expand Its Empire<BR>阿里巴巴利润下滑</P>

<P>SHENZHEN, China ― Alibaba, the online shopping giant, is increasingly going offline.</P>

<P>中国深圳――线上购物巨头阿里巴巴(Alibaba)越来越走向线下。</P>

<P>The Chinese company on Friday reported a fall in profit of nearly 30 percent in the latest quarter, the first such decline in a year and a half. One reason: Alibaba got a bump in profit last year from selling its shares in a social media app. Another culprit, however, was heavy spending on Alibaba’s businesses outside of e-commerce, including cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail ― which the company, counterintuitively, likes to call “new retail.”</P>

<P>这家中国公司周五宣布最近一个季度利润下降近30%，这是它一年半以来利润首次下滑。其中一个原因是，阿里巴巴去年卖出一款社交媒体应用的股份，利润激增。但另一个根本原因是，阿里巴巴在电子商务之外的业务领域支出巨大，包括云计算和实体零售。阿里巴巴有违直觉地喜欢把后者叫做“新零售”。</P>

<P>Those ventures are part of Alibaba’s plan to broaden its empire and become more of a full-service technology company akin to Google. But some investors appear to be fretting about the cost of such expansion to the company’s profits. Alibaba has already lost around $60 billion in market value since its shares peaked in January.</P>

<P>这些业务是阿里巴巴扩大商业帝国，变得更像一家类似于谷歌(Google)的全服务科技公司计划的一部分。但一些投资者似乎担心这种扩张对公司利润的影响。自1月股价达到最高点以来，阿里巴巴的市值已蒸发大约600亿美元（约合3800亿元人民币）。</P>

<P>They remain well above their level a year ago, however, thanks to strength in Alibaba’s core online business. In the first three months of the year, total revenue increased by more than 60 percent over the same period last year, the company said Friday. It added that it expects a similar pace of sales growth for the coming financial year.</P>

<P>然而，多亏了核心的线上业务实力雄厚，阿里巴巴的表现仍远超一年前的水平。该公司周五表示，今年前三个月总收入同比增加逾60%。阿里巴巴还补充说，预计下一财年的销售增长会保持相似的水平。</P>

<P>For what has become one of the biggest internet companies on the planet, figuring out how to get even bigger was never going to be straightforward. Or cheap.</P>

<P>对于已是全球最大互联网公司之一的阿里巴巴来说，搞清楚怎么进一步扩大规模从来都不是一件简单的事情。也不是一件低成本的事。</P>

<P>In March, Alibaba poured an additional $2 billion into its Southeast Asian online emporium, Lazada, which is duking it out with Amazon in the region. Back at home in China, the company is investing heavily in its entertainment and cloud services businesses, both of which lose money. And it is rapidly expanding its footprint in physical retail, to collect more different kinds of data about customers’ habits and desires.</P>

<P>3月，阿里巴巴再次向其在东南亚的线上商城拉扎达(Lazada)注入20亿美元。拉扎达正在该地区同亚马逊(Amazon)竞争。在中国国内，阿里巴巴正在大举投资娱乐和云服务业务，这两个领域目前都处于亏损状态。此外，阿里巴巴还在迅速扩大其在实体零售领域的印迹，以便收集更多不同类型的消费者习惯和意愿相关数据。</P>

<P>But compared with being an online middleman, running stores in the real world is costly and complex. Hema, the company’s chain of high-tech supermarkets, now has dozens of stores across China, a large chunk of which opened in the first four months of this year alone.</P>

<P>但和充当线上中间商相比，在现实世界中开店代价高昂，情况复杂。该公司的高科技连锁超市盒马目前在中国各地有几十家门店，其中很大一部分是在今年前4个月开张的。</P>

<P>Modest minimarts these are not. A typical store might feature tanks of live lobsters and crabs, a bar with beer on tap and a grill where steaks are cooked to order. Bags of groceries zip on conveyors above shoppers’ heads on their way to being delivered to nearby homes.</P>

<P>它们不是简陋的便利店。典型的盒马门店里可能会有成箱的活龙虾和螃蟹、一个提供桶装啤酒的酒吧和一个现点现做牛排的烧烤店。袋装的食品杂货在消费者头顶的传送带上运输，再送往附近的消费者家中。</P>

<P>Fresh food aside, Alibaba has also invested in an electronics retailer, a home-improvement chain and a department store operator. Recently, it opened a mall in its home city, Hangzhou. It took control last year of its logistics affiliate, Cainiao, and in April it swallowed up a food-delivery service, Ele.me.</P>

<P>除新鲜食品外，阿里巴巴还投资了一家电子产品零售商、一个家居装饰连锁和一家百货商店运营商。最近，该公司在其大本营所在的城市杭州开了一家购物中心。阿里巴巴去年取得了对其物流子公司菜鸟的控制权，并在4月收购了送餐服务公司饿了么。</P>

<P>All of these could someday help turn Alibaba into the vast digital enabler of on- and offline commerce that it wishes to be. But for now, they are new and unfamiliar activities for a company that prides itself on not owning much in the way of merchandise, warehouses, delivery trucks or other physical assets.</P>

<P>也许有一天，所有这些会帮助阿里巴巴如愿以偿，成为一个庞大的线上和线下商业平台。但目前，对一家以没有太多商品、仓库、送货卡车或其他有形资产而自豪的公司来说，这些都是它不熟悉的新领域。</P>

<P>It does not help that the company’s archrival in China, the internet conglomerate Tencent, is also storming into many of these same businesses, including traditional retail.</P>

<P>而且阿里巴巴在中国的劲敌、互联网企业集团腾讯也在大举进军很多相同的业务领域，包括传统零售。</P>

<P>“I like Hema,” said Tian X. Hou, founder of T.H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. “But Alibaba management is going to have to do a lot of thinking, and go through a lot of trial and error.”</P>

<P>&nbsp;“我喜欢盒马，”北京研究公司天灏资本的创始人侯晓天说。“但阿里巴巴管理层必须要多动脑筋，要经历大量的试错。”</P>

<P>Despite investors’ worries, Ms. Hou said, Alibaba executives are at least sounding more resolute about their commitment to this new, offline future for the company.</P>

<P>侯晓天说，尽管投资者感到担忧，但阿里巴巴的高管至少听上去对致力于公司新的线下未来决心很大。</P>

<P>“They are fully communicating with the Street: ‘We’re doing it. And we actually do not care what you think, because we think it’s great, and it is the way to reach offline customers. It’s the way to sell in product categories that are not sold online. It is the way for us to expand.’”</P>

<P>“他们正在与华尔街充分沟通：我们正在这么做。我们其实并不在乎你们怎么想，因为我们认为它很好，是获取线下客户的途径，是销售不在线上销售的产品品类的方式，是我们扩张的方式。”</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>Xiaomi, a Chinese Start-Up, Picks Hong Kong for a Major I.P.O.<BR>小米申请在港上市</P>

<P>HONG KONG ― Xiaomi, the Chinese gadget maker that has become one of the world’s largest smartphone companies, has picked Hong Kong to list its shares in what is widely expected to be a major initial public offering.</P>

<P>香港――中国电子设备制造商小米选择香港作为上市地点，外界普遍预期这将成为一次规模巨大的首次公开募股(IPO)。小米目前已经成为了世界上最大的智能手机公司之一。</P>

<P>The choice is a victory for the Chinese city, which missed out on blockbuster stock offerings by Alibaba and other rising internet companies in mainland China in recent years. Just days ago, officials at Hong Kong’s stock exchange had loosened its rules to land some big tech stock offerings.</P>

<P>小米的选择对香港这座城市而言可谓一次胜利，后者错过了近几年阿里巴巴及其他中国大陆崛起的互联网公司的轰动性IPO。就在几天前，港交所的官员们刚刚放宽了规定，以获得一些大型科技公司的股票发行。</P>

<P>In a filing on Thursday with Hong Kong’s stock exchange, Xiaomi said it planned to raise an unspecified amount of money through a public sale of shares. It said it would use the money to develop new smartphones, smart TVs, home speakers and other households gadgets, as well as to finance its ambitions to expand beyond the Chinese market.</P>

<P>在一份向港交所提交的申请中，小米表示计划将通过公开募股筹集资金，具体数额未作说明。小米表示将利用该资金开发新的智能手机、智能电视、家用音响及其他家用电子设备，还将为该公司扩展至中国市场之外的雄心提供资金。</P>

<P>The filing indicates that Xiaomi will take advantage of Hong Kong rules that now allow companies to issue supervoting shares to top insiders as well as shares with lesser voting rights to the public. Xiaomi said Lei Jun, its founder, chairman and chief executive, would retain control of the company after the offering because of that arrangement.</P>

<P>该文件表明，小米将利用香港现在允许企业向高级内部人士发行优先股股票，并向公众发行投票权较少的股票的规则。小米称，因为这种安排，其创始人、董事长兼首席执行官雷军将在股票发行后保留对公司的控制权。</P>

<P>Xiaomi began as a maker of cheap smartphones that were sometimes criticized for aping Apple’s iPhone. It nurtured a strong following through viral marketing techniques and a community of users it nurtured in China who would suggest tweaks and fixes to the operating system that runs the phones.</P>

<P>小米作为廉价智能手机制造商起家，那些产品有时被批评为模仿苹果的iPhone。它通过大量传播营销和它在中国建立的用户群体培养了一批忠实的追随者，他们会对手机的操作系统提供调整和修复建议。</P>

<P>The company stumbled two years ago as other Chinese companies, like Huawei Technologies and Oppo, began turning out phones at competitive prices. Since then, Xiaomi has refurbished its lineup and begun an expansion into India and other new markets. The company is now the worlds fourth-largest smartphone maker, according the International Data Corporation, behind Samsung Electronics, Apple and Huawei.</P>

<P>两年前，当华为和Oppo等其他中国公司开始以具有竞争力的价格推出手机时，小米遭遇挫折。此后，它重新整合了阵容，并开始向印度和其他新兴市场扩张。据国际数据公司(International Data Corporation)称，小米目前是全球第四大的智能手机制造商，仅次于三星电子(Samsung Electronics)、苹果(Apple)和华为。</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.<BR>Facebook令人毛骨悚然，但它也很有价值</P>

<P>One of the most telling moments in the spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony last week was when Representative Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, warned the co-founder of Facebook of what Congress was likely to do about its multiple concerns surrounding the social network. “Congress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting,” he said. After years of the former, he said, “we’re getting ready to overreact.”</P>

<P>上周在马克・扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)出席国会作证的大场面中，最说明问题的时刻之一便是密苏里州共和党众议员比利・朗(Billy Long)警告这位Facebook的联合创始人，基于对社交网络的多重关注，国会可能会做些什么。他说：“国会擅长两件事：无所作为和反应过度。”经历了几年的无所作为，他说，“如今我们已经准备好反应过度。”</P>

<P>That sounds worrisome. But I sympathize. Doing nothing and overreacting make sense when you have no clue of what is going on. And we don’t. The cloud of questions aimed at Mr. Zuckerberg ― Is Facebook too dominant? Does it censor information? Whom does it share our data with? Does it help sell OxyContin? ― suggests that we don’t really know what the problem with Facebook is. It also suggests we don’t understand what Facebook does.</P>

<P>这听起来令人担忧。但我有同感。如果你完全不知道发生了什么，无所作为和过度反应都是有道理的。而我们确实什么也不知道。围绕扎克伯格的大量问题――Facebook的支配地位是否太强？它是否会审查信息？它与谁共享我们的数据？它帮助销售奥施康定(OxyContin，一种阿片类镇痛药――编注)吗？――表明我们并不真正了解Facebook到底有什么问题。也表明我们并不理解Facebook到底在做什么。</P>

<P>That goes for the entire data-driven ecosystem, from Google to the auto companies riddling your car with sensors that can tell where you’ve been and how fast you got there. And that puts policymakers in an uncomfortable spot.</P>

<P>这种情况适用于整个由数据驱动的生态系统，从谷歌到那些让传感器布满你车子的汽车企业，那些传感器可以知悉你去过哪里，以及你到达那里的速度。这一切让政策制定者感到不安。</P>

<P>The crucial issue for Congress, government regulators, members of the public and even Mr. Zuckerberg is how much all this data-driven stuff is worth to us. What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect? What do we stand to gain?</P>

<P>国会、政府监管机构、公众，乃至扎克伯格本人面临的关键问题是，这些数据驱动的东西对我们来说有多么重要。如果严格限制这些公司可收集的数据，我们可能会失去什么？我们可能会获得什么？</P>

<P>As Alessandro Acquisti of Carnegie Mellon University and colleagues put it in a recent paper, the question is “to what extent the combination of sophisticated analytics and massive amounts of consumer data will lead to an increase in aggregate welfare, and to what extent will it lead to mere changes in the allocation of wealth?”</P>

<P>正如卡耐基梅隆大学(Carnegie Mellon University)的亚历山德罗・阿奎斯蒂(Alessandro Acquisti)及同事在近期一篇论文中所说的，问题是“复杂的分析与大量消费者数据的结合将在多大程度上带来总体福利的增加，以及在多大程度上仅仅导致财富分配的变化？”</P>

<P>We don’t know.</P>

<P>我们不得而知。</P>

<P>“We don’t understand the value to us of the new data economy nor the risks it entails,” said Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has studied the economic impact of data. “We just let it rip and now are trying to catch up.” Unfortunately, we have only rudimentary tools to measure the good and the bad.</P>

<P>“我们并不了解新数据经济对我们的价值，也不了解它带来的风险，”费城联邦储备银行(Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)经济学家、研究数据经济影响的莱昂纳多・中村(Leonard Nakamura)表示。“我们只是任其迅速发展，现在试图努力赶上它的步伐。”不幸的是，我们只有非常原始的工具来衡量它的优劣。</P>

<P>As the data-driven economy continues evolving at breakneck speed, catching up may be beyond our reach; we will build the guardrails by trial and error. The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.</P>

<P>随着数据驱动的经济继续以惊人的速度发展，我们可能已经来不及追赶；我们将通过反复试验和出错来为自己构建护栏。风险在于政策将主要由恐惧驱动。</P>

<P>What is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow’s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.</P>

<P>Facebook到底出了什么问题？显然，莫斯科利用这个平台传播假新闻，影响2016年大选结果是其中之一。它允许数千万用户的数据在用户本人不知情的情况下，流向一家为唐纳德・特朗普工作的政治咨询机构，这是另一个问题。</P>

<P>But the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users’ knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers ― including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.</P>

<P>但这一数据经济巨头的原始商业模式本身就令人毛骨悚然。首先，Facebook往往在用户不知情的情况下挖掘的个人数据规模之大。该平台不仅获得你与平台共享的数据，还会从你认识的其他Facebook用户的文件中收集你的信息。它从数据掮客那里购买关于你的线下生活的数据，包括收入和你名下的信用卡等敏感信息。扎克伯格在众议院作证时承认，Facebook甚至获取了根本没有使用Facebook的人的信息，以便将广告有针对性地投放给他们。</P>

<P>Mr. Zuckerberg noted that this data is what makes Facebook valuable for its advertisers and its users, enabling the network to offer them only relevant ads. But it also gives it inordinate power over people’s lives. It wouldn’t be impossible, for instance, to use Facebook’s sophisticated models to send a deluge of ads for weight-loss pills to overweight teenagers with a fragile self-image. We know that Facebook can determine, and manipulate, its users’ emotional states.</P>

<P>扎克伯格指出，这些数据令Facebook对它的广告客户以及它的用户很有价值，使其能够只提供与他们相关的广告。但它也对人们的生活施加了过度的权力。例如，使用Facebook的复杂模型，向超重及自我感觉脆弱的青少年投放大量减肥药广告，这是有可能办到的。我们知道Facebook可以搞清并操纵用户的情绪状态。</P>

<P>Data can also be deployed for virtual redlining. And what about price discrimination? Amazon and others have already experimented with mining our data to charge “personalized” prices for a given item ― the maximum price each of us is willing to pay ― a practice that can leave many consumers worse off.</P>

<P>数据也可以被用来搞虚拟信贷歧视。那么差别定价呢？亚马逊和其他公司已经开始尝试挖掘我们的数据，对特定商品收取“个性化”价格――也就是我们所有人愿意支付的最高价格――这种做法可能会让许多消费者更吃亏。</P>

<P>But policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don’t like it.</P>

<P>但是，政策不能仅仅由美国企业可能对我们的数据所做的潜在阴暗行为来决定。也许精确的差别定价永远不会出现，因为消费者不喜欢它。</P>

<P>Indeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data ― leading scholars to coin the term “privacy paradox.” As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, “Lots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.”</P>

<P>事实上，目前还不清楚消费者对它们的排斥程度。尽管调查一再表明美国人关心自己的隐私，但他们却很少采取行动，阻止用于收集数据的cookie和其他工具――这一领域的重要学者造出“隐私悖论”这个词来描述这种现象。麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院(Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)的斯南・阿拉尔(Sinan Aral)指出：“很多依赖于广告的东西是我们视为公共物品所需要的。”</P>

<P>Critically, to regulate the data-enabled world, we must first figure out what we stand to lose if the data goes uncollected. For instance, research found that privacy rules introduced by the European Union in the 1990s reduced the effectiveness of online advertising. What, then, is the social cost?</P>

<P>至关重要的是，为了规范由数据支持的世界，我们必须先弄清楚，如果不收集数据，我们会失去什么。例如，研究发现，欧盟在上世纪90年代实行的隐私规定降低了在线广告的有效性。那么，它的社会成本又会是什么呢？</P>

<P>Mr. Nakamura and two colleagues at the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculated how much of the nation’s gross domestic product came from the “free” digital economy powered by advertising that drives Facebook’s and Google’s business. From 1995 to 2005, they found, it added 0.07 percentage points to the economy’s annual growth rate. From 2005 to 2015, it added 0.11 percentage points.</P>

<P>中村和经济分析局(Bureau of Economic Analysis)的两名同事算出了美国的多少国内生产总值来自广告驱动的“免费”数字经济――Facebook和谷歌的运营靠的正是这些广告。他们发现，从1995年到2005年，它为美国经济的年增长率增加了0.07个百分点。从2005年到2015年，它增加了0.11个百分点。</P>

<P>But this must understate the data economy’s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.</P>

<P>但这应该是低估了数据经济给我们的生活康乐做出的贡献。对世界各地的20亿人来说，Facebook是极具价值的交流和互动模式。该公司发表的内部研究表明，在社交网络上进行大量分享的人更快乐、更健康。</P>

<P>Facebook’s advertising tools ― the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn ― provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.</P>

<P>Facebook的广告工具为小本经营的商家提供了划算的营销机会，过去只有大公司才有这种机会。这些工具利用你的数据来判断你是否应该看到康涅狄格州一个卖有机纱线的小商店的广告。</P>

<P>More broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of “free” music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus ― the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it ― is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.</P>

<P>中村指出，从更广泛的角度来看，以数据收集和广告为动力的网络经济正在改善民众的福利，而这一点在经济产出的标准衡量方式中没有得到充分体现。这包括大量的“免费”音乐以及经过个人数据训练的人工智能的潜在益处。消费者顺差指的是我们从那些实际价值超出我们支付的价格的商品或服务中获得的益处。目前的消费者顺差超过以往任何时候，而且还会进一步增长。</P>

<P>And yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.</P>

<P>这听起来像是在主张对数据驱动的数字经济完全不加监管，但实际上不是。人们有理由担心Facebook和它的一些同行可能已经非常强大，足以压制创新。也有理由怀疑它随意处置消费者数据。</P>

<P>Regulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths ― say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future ― make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.</P>

<P>我们有理由去监管、限制数字巨头们的力量，比如，禁止他们收购Instagram和WhatsApp等可能威胁它们未来主导地位的新兴公司。我们也有理由制订政策，确保它们对自己收集的数据进行负责任的管理。</P>

<P>”I don’t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,” said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. “The idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.”</P>

<P>“我认为，正确的政策立场不应该是完全取消这种商业模式，而应该是进行一些限制，”联邦贸易委员会(Federal Trade Commission)中唯一的民主党人特雷尔・麦克斯威尼(Terrell McSweeny)说。“目的是让人们对自己数据的使用有更多的控制权，确保公司负责任地使用数据。”</P>

<P>Summoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.</P>

<P>传唤扎克伯格作证表明，国会不再满足于什么都不做。希望它的举措不要只是对自己的恐惧做出过度反应而已。</P>

One gang, called La Familia Michoacana, announced its presence about a decade ago by tossing five rivals’ heads onto a dance floor in the town of Uruapan. The Knights Templar muscled in next, spouting a chivalric code of honor as it taxed, extorted and kidnapped farmers and usurped their land. Mexican security forces and local landowners have tried to fight back, but warring cartels continue to splinter and proliferate. In March, an armed group known as Los Viagras ― apparently named for the way their leader’s heavily moussed hair stands up ― wreaked havoc by burning dozens of vehicles and effectively shutting down the state’s main highway. One conflagration took place not far from where an American businessman named Steve Barnard owns a packing plant in Uruapan. “It’s too dangerous to drive on the roads,” Barnard says. The farm owners “have to be very careful not to get kidnapped.”</P>

<P>在墨西哥米却肯州的火山脚下，暴力团伙都在争夺一个神秘且利润丰厚的市场的控制权。约十年前，其中一个名为米却肯家族(La Familia Michoacana)的帮派，将五名对手的脑袋扔到了乌鲁阿潘城的一家舞厅，宣示了自己的存在。接着，圣殿骑士(The Knights Templar)挤了进来，在课税、威胁和绑架农民，侵占他们土地的同时，大谈骑士准则。墨西哥安全部队及当地的土地所有者曾试图回击，但相互交战的暴力集团继续分裂，数量激增。3月，一个名为伟哥帮（Los Viagras，这个名字显然来源于该组织头目抹了大量摩丝而竖起的发型）的武装组织烧毁数十辆汽车，导致该州的主要高速公路关闭，造成巨大的破坏。其中一场大火发生的地点，距离美国商人史蒂夫・巴纳德(Steve Barnard)在乌鲁阿潘的包装厂不远。“在路上开车太危险了，”巴纳德说。农场主“必须要非常小心，才不会被绑架”。</P>

<P>The precious commodity that drives Michoacán’s economy and feeds an American obsession is not marijuana or methamphetamines but avocados, which local residents have taken to calling “green gold.” Mexico produces more of the fruit than any country in the world ― about a third of the global total ― and most of its crop is grown in the rich volcanic soil of Michoacán, upland from the beaches of Acapulco. It is one of the miracles of modern trade that in 2017, Mexico’s most violent year on record, this cartel-riddled state exported more than 1.7 billion pounds of Haas avocados to the United States, helping them surpass bananas as America’s most valuable fruit import. Nine out of every 10 imported avocados in the United States come from Michoacán.</P>

<P>推动米却肯州经济、满足美国人迷恋的珍贵商品不是大麻或冰毒，而是牛油果，当地人称之为“绿色黄金”。墨西哥生产的这种水果比世界上任何国家都多，约为全球总产量的三分之一，它主要种植在米却肯州肥沃的火山土壤里，也就是从阿卡普尔科海滩升起的高地上。它是现代贸易的奇迹之一，在2017年――墨西哥有记录以来最为暴力的一年，这个暴力团伙活动猖獗的州向美国出口了超过17亿磅哈斯牛油果，使其超过香蕉，成为美国价值最高的进口水果。每10个进口到美国的牛油果中，就有9个来自米却肯州。</P>

<P>The real marvel of Mexico’s avocado trade, however, is not so much its size as the speed of its sudden growth. Avocados have been cultivated in Mexico for around 9,000 years. (When Spanish conquistadors first encountered the oblong fruit in the early 16th century, they called it aguacate, after ahuacatl, an Aztec word that means testicle.) Despite this deep history, Mexico exported very few avocados ― and none at all to the United States ― through the 1980s, when Barnard’s California-based company, Mission Produce, opened the first avocado-packing plant in Uruapan. The United States had banned Mexican avocados since 1914 over fears of an insect infestation and cheaper competition. But in 1994, Mexico, Canada and the United States enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement ― and soon thereafter the United States began lifting its ban.</P>

<P>然而，墨西哥牛油果贸易真正的奇迹并非其贸易规模，而是它突然间的增速。牛油果在墨西哥已经有约9000年的历史了。（当时西班牙征服者于16世纪早期第一次见到了这种椭圆形的水果，他们根据阿芝特克人形容睾丸的词“ahuacatl”，将其称之为“aguacate”。）尽管有着悠久历史，但整个1980年代，墨西哥的牛油果出口量非常少――对美国则完全没有出口。当时巴纳德总部位于加利福尼亚的公司“使命生产”(Mission Produce)开设了乌鲁阿潘的第一家牛油果包装厂。由于担忧会出现虫害和廉价竞争，美国自1914年开始禁止进口墨西哥牛油果。但在1994年，墨西哥、加拿大和美国通过了《北美自由贸易协议》(North American Free Trade Agreement)――那之后不久，美国就取消了禁令。</P>

<P>An avocado explosion followed. In 1994, Americans consumed a little more than one pound of the fruit per person per year ― almost all from California growers, whose harvest comes only in the summer. Today, that figure is up to seven pounds per person year-round. Fueled by a growing Latino community and Hollywood stars promoting the health benefits of the fruit’s unsaturated fats (Miley Cyrus has an avocado tattoo on her arm), America’s avocado craze has intensified every year. An estimated 135 million pounds of avocados were consumed in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl last month. (The Super Bowl is America’s top avocado day, just ahead of Cinco de Mayo.) “The boom caught everybody by surprise,” says Barnard, whose company is the world’s largest avocado distributor. “We’re really scrambling. We’re growing at 10 to 15 percent per year, but we still can’t keep up with demand.”</P>

<P>一场牛油果大爆发随之而来。1994年，美国人每人每年购买了一磅多这种水果――几乎全部产自加利福尼亚的种植户，他们的收获季只有夏天。如今，这个数字已经增长到了七磅。受不断增长的拉丁裔群体和好莱坞明星对这种水果所含不饱和脂肪的宣传（歌手麦莉・塞勒斯[Miley Cyrus]的胳膊上有一个牛油果文身）所推动，美国的牛油果狂热逐年加剧。上个月的超级碗前几周，美国人购买了约1350万磅牛油果。（超级碗是美国最大的牛油果日，略微领先五月五日节[Cinco de Mayo]。）“这种增长让所有人都很吃惊，”巴纳德说，他的公司是世界上最大的牛油果分销商。“我们真的手忙脚乱。我们每年的增长速度为10%到15%，但还是无法跟上需求。”</P>

<P>Donald Trump has often railed at Nafta as “the worst trade deal ever.” But his focus on the loss of United States manufacturing jobs ― felt keenly in the auto and textile industries ― misses one of Nafta’s far-reaching benefits: the huge lift it has given to agricultural trade and consumer satisfaction in all three countries. Under Nafta, avocados have led an influx of year-round Mexican produce that has filled the seasonal voids in United States grocery stores and changed the way Americans eat. The avocado boom has caused environmental damage ― some of Michoacán’s pine forests have been thinned out for avocado orchards ― but it has been good for Americans gorging on guacamole in wintertime and Mexican farmers fending off the urge to join the drug trade or immigrate to the United States. According to a 2016 study commissioned by a marketing group for buyers and producers of Mexican avocados, the avocado supply chain has also created nearly 19,000 jobs in the United States and added more than $2.2 billion to the gross national product.</P>

<P>唐纳德・特朗普经常指责《北美自由贸易协定》是“有史以来最糟糕的贸易协定”。但他关注的是美国制造业就业岗位的流失（尤其是汽车和纺织业），而忽略了该协定的一个深远益处：它极大提升了这三个国家的农业贸易和消费者满意度。由于该协定，以牛油果为主的墨西哥农产品一年四季出口到美国，填补了美国食品杂货店的季节性空白，改变了美国人的饮食习惯。牛油果贸易的兴旺造成了环境破坏――米却肯州的一些松林被牛油果果园侵占，但它让美国人得以在冬季尽情享受牛油果沙拉，帮助墨西哥农民抵御加入毒品贸易或移民到美国的冲动。2016年，为墨西哥牛油果的消费者和生产者服务的一个营销小组委托进行了一项研究，发现牛油果供应链在美国创造了近1.9万个工作岗位，国民生产总值增加了22亿美元。</P>

<P>Even California growers, once vociferous opponents of Mexican imports, are happy with the situation. Land and water are too scarce to expand their seasonal harvests ― which are around 10 percent of Mexico’s annual production ― but surging demand and prices have buoyed their businesses, too. “Avocados are Nafta’s shining star,” says Monica Ganley, an expert on Latin American trade and the founder of Quarterra, a consulting firm based in Buenos Aires. “But it’s important to remember that the benefits flow in both directions.” Under Nafta, United States agricultural exports to Mexico have expanded nearly fivefold, to $18 billion, with sales of American corn, soybeans and dairy products booming south of the border. “Trade is a multiplier, not a zero-sum game,” Ganley says. “We tend to overstate how much Mexico is dependent on the U.S. But American producers may have more to lose than Mexican producers if Nafta disappears.”</P>

<P>就连曾经强烈反对墨西哥进口的加州种植者也对这种情况感到满意。加州的土地和水太过稀缺，无法扩大季节性收成――他们的年产量大约是墨西哥的10%――但是高涨的需求和价格也提振了他们的生意。“牛油果是北美自由贸易协定的明星，”布宜诺斯艾利斯咨询公司Quarterra的创始人、拉丁美洲贸易专家莫妮卡・甘利(Monica Ganley)说。“但重要的是，要记住，好处是双向的。”由于《北美自由贸易协定》，美国对墨西哥的农业出口增长了近5倍，达到180亿美元，美国的玉米、大豆和奶制品在边境以南销售旺盛。“贸易是一种倍增，不是零和博弈，”甘利说，“我们往往夸大了墨西哥对美国的依赖，但如果《北美自由贸易协定》被取消，那么，美国生产商的损失可能会比墨西哥生产商更沉重。”</P>

<P>Trump hasn’t killed Nafta yet. But as negotiations over a revamped agreement head into their eighth round, a trade war looms. The United States decision last month to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on most countries hangs over the talks, as do the planned trade sanctions against China. Trump offered temporary exemptions to Canada and Mexico, but only with the proviso that they remake Nafta to his liking. Even within the talks, avocado growers in Mexico and California worry that new anti-dumping duties proposed by the United States side could lead to a tit-for-tat retaliation that would harm both sides. “Once it starts,” Barnard asks, “where does it end?”</P>

<P>特朗普还没有扼杀《北美自由贸易协定》。但关于修订该协定的谈判已进入第8轮，贸易战渐渐逼近。美国上个月决定对大多数国家征收钢铝关税，还在计划对中国进行贸易制裁――这些都笼罩着修订谈判。特朗普暂时豁免了加拿大和墨西哥的钢铝关税，但前提是，他们要按照他的喜好对《北美自由贸易协定》进行修改。甚至在谈判过程中，墨西哥和加州的牛油果种植者就开始担心，美国提出的新反倾销税可能导致针锋相对的报复行动，这将损害双方的利益。“一旦开始，”巴纳德问，“什么时候才能结束？”</P>

<P>So long as global demand keeps growing, though, the avocado seems almost impervious to upheaval at home and abroad. The violence in Michoacán, for example, has not curtailed the avocado industry’s goal of increasing exports to the United States by 15 percent this year. Nor would new tariffs necessarily stop Mexican avocado imports: The United States can’t sate its appetite for avocados elsewhere (no other producer is big enough), and the Mexicans have no other market so big and so near. The price of guacamole and avocado toast would go up again, but consumers already showed last year, during a spike in prices, that they might be willing to pay more. The bigger effect might be that avocado producers heighten their efforts in other developing markets, especially the one with most potential: China.</P>

<P>不过，只要全球需求持续增长，牛油果似乎基本上不受国内外动荡的影响。例如，米却肯州的暴力事件并没有影响牛油果行业今年向美国增加15%出口的目标。新关税也不一定会阻止墨西哥的牛油果进口：其他地方的牛油果无法充分满足美国的胃口（其他地方的生产量不够大），墨西哥也找不到其他如此庞大而又临近的市场。牛油果酱和牛油果吐司的价格会再次上涨，但去年的价格上涨已经表明，消费者可能愿意支付更高的价格。更大的影响可能是，牛油果生产商会加大在其他发展中市场的努力，尤其是潜力最大的市场：中国。</P>

<P>When I lived in Shanghai, I often bicycled to an open-air grocery store run by a woman everybody knew simply as the avocado lady. She was one of the first grocers in the city to carry what is known in Chinese as “butter fruit,” though her clients were mostly grateful expatriates like me or Chinese returning from abroad. Even on days of heavy storms or bitter cold, this hardy entrepreneur was always in her shop before dawn, wearing rubber boots and tallying prices with a pencil. I never learned her name, but last year, in an unnecessary bit of marketing, she hung a crudely painted sign ― “The Avocado Lady” ― in front of her store.</P>

<P>在上海住的时候，我经常骑自行车去一个露天食杂店。食杂店的老板是个女人，大家都叫她牛油果阿姨。她是上海最早卖牛油果的食杂店老板之一，但她的客户主要是像我一样心存感激的外国人，或是从国外回来的中国人。哪怕是狂风暴雨或严寒刺骨，这位顽强的企业家总是天不亮就到店里，穿着橡胶靴，用铅笔计算价格。我一直不知道她的名字，但去年，她进行了一点不必要的营销，在食杂店前面挂了一个涂刷粗糙的牌子，上面写着“The Avocado Lady”。</P>

<P>A decade ago, avocados were virtually unknown in China. The country imported only two tons in 2010; last year, it brought in 32,100 tons. The trend accelerated in 2017 when KFC ran an ad campaign for its avocado wraps called “Green Is Going Red” (to be hot, that is). It featured a pop star sporting an avocado mustache. The wraps didn’t sell so well, but the ads made avocados cool for China’s millennials.</P>

<P>十年前，牛油果在中国几乎不为人所知。2010年，中国只进口了两吨牛油果。去年，中国进口了32100吨。2017年，这一趋势加速。当时，肯德基(KFC)投放了名为“一绿爆红”的广告，宣传它的牛油果墨西哥卷。广告上，一个流行明星留着牛油果小胡子。肯德基的墨西哥卷卖得并不太好，但这些广告让中国的千禧一代觉得牛油果很酷。</P>

<P>Mexico was China’s largest supplier of avocados until last year, when it was surpassed by Chile. (Peru is moving in quickly, too.) In the future, the competition may come from China itself. With state backing, some Chinese businessmen are developing avocado plantations in the southern province of Guangxi. If they can come up with an avocado that matches the Latin American variety, at a lower cost, then the global market could shift.</P>

<P>墨西哥一直是中国最大的牛油果供应国，直到去年被智利反超。（秘鲁也在迅速追赶。）未来，竞争可能来自中国国内。在国家的支持下，一些中国商人正在中国南方的广西省开发牛油果种植园。如果他们能以较低的成本种出与拉丁美的品种不相上下的牛油果，全球市场可能会发生变化。</P>

<P>For now, though, China is adjusting. Most avocados sold there are hard and green ― often to the confusion of the uninitiated. To solve this problem, Barnard’s Mission Produce built China’s first “ripe center” in Shanghai last year, with another to follow in Shenzhen next year. And Barnard is dreaming big. “If I could put four avocado chunks in every bowl of noodle soup in China,” he muses, “we wouldn’t have enough avocados in the world.” Only Mexican production would come close. And who knows? If American trade policy lurches toward a trade war, the farmers under the volcanoes in Michoacán might be eager to start sending their harvests to China instead.</P>

<P>但目前，中国正在调整。中国卖的牛油果大多又硬又绿，这常常让外行感到困惑。为了解决这个问题，巴纳德的使命生产公司(Mission Produce)去年在上海建立了中国首个“催熟中心”，明年还将在深圳再建一个。巴纳德理想远大。“如果在中国的每一碗汤面里放四块牛油果，”他想，“全世界的牛油果都不够。”只有墨西哥的产量接近。而且谁知道呢？如果美国的贸易政策转向贸易战，米却肯州火山下的农民可能会迫不及待地开始把他们的收成运往中国。</P>

<P>Aiming at China’s Armpits: When Foreign Brands Misfire<BR>瞄不准的腋窝：为什么除臭香体露在中国不受欢迎</P>

<P>BEIJING ― Unilever brought its Rexona deodorant to China a decade ago, dreaming of a market with 2.6 billion armpits.</P>

<P>北京――联合利华(Unilever)十年前就把舒耐(Rexona)香体露带进了中国，梦想着一个有26亿腋窝的市场。</P>

<P>Wages were rising, consumers were spending and the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics was making Chinese people feel more cosmopolitan. More of them, it stood to reason, would be open to a Western hygiene product.</P>

<P>工资在增长，消费者在花钱，而即将举行的2008年北京奥运会也使中国人更有国际化的感觉。按理说，会有更多人愿意接受这个西方的卫生用品。</P>

<P>“We had created established markets for Rexona from scratch in many countries, and we did not see any reason why we couldn’t do the same in China,” Frank Braeken, Unilever’s former China head, said by telephone from Dubai, where he now works as an investment consultant.</P>

<P>“我们在许多国家都能为舒耐从零开始打下一片成熟的市场，我们在中国没理由不能照做，”联合利华大中华区前总裁薄睿凯(Frank Braeken)通过电话表示，他现于迪拜担任投资顾问。</P>

<P>“We had an extremely ambitious plan at the time,” Mr. Braeken said.</P>

<P>“我们当时有一个非常有野心的计划，”薄睿凯说道。</P>

<P>But cultural differences and simple biology ― scientists have shown that many East Asian people don’t have Westerners’ body odor issues ― scotched those plans. Sales totaled only a fraction of the Chinese marketing budget for Rexona, Mr. Braeken said. Today, by some estimates, less than 10 percent of China’s population uses deodorant, and it can be hard to find outside major cities.</P>

<P>但文化差异和简单的生理问题――科学家已经证明许多东亚人并没有西方人的体味问题――阻挠了这些计划。薄睿凯说，舒耐在中国的销售总量只达市场营销预算的一小部分。据估计，目前，中国只有不到10%的人口使用香体露，在大城市之外更加难找。</P>

<P>China’s growing consumer class has fueled global growth and lifted the fortunes of Starbucks, KFC and a host of other Western brands. Many Chinese people now drink coffee instead of tea, eat cheese and ice cream despite potential tummy tremors, and guzzle ice-cold sodas in a country where grandmothers express a mortal fear at any liquid below room temperature.</P>

<P>中国不断增长的消费阶层推动着全球经济增长，为星巴克(Starbucks)、肯德基(KFC)等一大堆西方品牌增添了财富。许多中国人现在会喝咖啡而不是喝茶，即使可能会出现肠胃不适也要吃奶酪和冰激凌，而在这个老奶奶见到低于室温的饮料都会表现出极度恐惧的国家，人们也开始狂饮冰冷的汽水。</P>

<P>But the drive to win China’s consumers has had its notable failures.</P>

<P>但赢得中国消费者的努力曾有过重大失败。</P>

<P>Like tampons.</P>

<P>如卫生棉条。</P>

<P>Most Chinese women use sanitary pads because they believe tampons are invasive. In 2016, China spent $136 million on tampons, only a fraction of the $4.9 billion annual sales for sanitary pads and towels in the country, according to data from Mintel, a consulting firm.</P>

<P>大多数中国女性使用卫生巾，因为她们认为卫生棉条是侵入性的。根据咨询公司英敏特(Mintel)提供的数据，2016年，中国在卫生棉条上的花销只有1.36亿美元，跟中国卫生护垫和卫生巾49亿年销售额比起来只是个零头。</P>

<P>Procter &amp; Gamble, the American consumer products company, gave up on Tampax in China in 2000, though it relaunched the brand last year. In a statement, Li Fengting, China director for the Tampax brand, said it had reintroduced the product in hopes of attracting a younger generation of women.</P>

<P>美国日用消费品公司宝洁(Procter &amp; Gamble)早在2000年就在中国放弃了丹碧丝(Tampax)，不过去年将其重新推出。在一则声明中，中国丹碧丝品牌的中国区总裁李凤婷表示，公司重新推出这个产品是希望能吸引更年轻一代的女性。</P>

<P>Then there’s Weetabix. Bright Food, a Shanghai-based company, bought a majority stake in the maker of the oblong staple of British breakfasts in 2012, hoping the cereal biscuits would find their way onto the Chinese family menu. It sold the stake to an American firm five years later, after what analysts said was a lackluster performance. A Bright Food spokesman, Pan Jianjun, said the decision to sell was part of the company’s international strategy but declined to comment further.</P>

<P>还有维多麦(Weetabix)。总部位于上海的光明食品集团在2012年买下了这家谷物饼干生产商的多数股权，希望这种长方形英式早餐主食能走进中国的家庭菜单。5年后，在分析人士所说的平平无奇的业绩下，它们将股权卖给了一家美国公司。光明食品集团的发言人潘建军表示，出售股权的决定是公司国际战略的一部分，但拒绝进一步置评。</P>

<P>Companies like Apple and Starbucks have prospered in part by selling aspirational products to Chinese consumers who want to show the world that they have made it. That task is tougher for products that nobody sees.</P>

<P>苹果(Apple)和星巴克等公司能够成功，部分原因在于向中国消费者出售了能向世界彰显他们的成功的产品。而这个任务对于人们看不到的产品来说更加困难。</P>

<P>“It has to be something visible or something you can smell,” said Ye Tan, an independent economist in Shanghai. “Deodorant fails partly because it is invisible.”</P>

<P>“它必须是能看得见，或能闻得到的东西，”上海独立经济学家叶檀说。“香体露的失败部分是因为人们看不见它。”</P>

<P>The products have their Chinese adherents. Cai Qianyi, a 38-year-old media professional in Beijing, started using deodorant in 2006, when he was studying in France. He doesn’t think he has body odor but sees a problem with sweat stains.</P>

<P>这些产品也有中国的追随者。在北京的38岁媒体人蔡谦从2006年开始使用香体露，那时他正在法国学习。他觉得自己没有体味，但认为汗渍是个问题。</P>

<P>“Sweat leaving wet spots on your T-shirt in the summer is extremely ugly, especially around the armpits, which could be really socially embarrassing,” Mr. Cai said.</P>

<P>“夏天的时候出汗会在T恤上留下汗渍，这样非常难看，尤其是在腋下附近。从社交的角度来说，这很尴尬，”蔡谦一说道。</P>

<P>But most of his family and friends have no idea what deodorant is, he said. Once, a cousin mistook his deodorant stick for perfume and asked him why it was solid.</P>

<P>但他大多数的家人和朋友并不知道什么是香体露，他说。有一次，一个亲戚误把它当成香水，还问他为什么这是固体的。</P>

<P>When global deodorant makers began their foray into China, they highlighted the social embarrassment caused by perspiration. Their central message was a proven winner in the West: Sweating will get you shunned socially and ruin your chances for romance.</P>

<P>当全球香体露厂商进军中国市场时，他们强调的是流汗给社会交往带来的尴尬。这个核心信息在西方证实是有效的：出汗会让你在社会交往中被人冷落，也会破坏情场上的机会。</P>

<P>That pitch fell on deaf ears in China, said Lucia Liu, a skin care assistant manager at Unilever who was involved in Rexona’s marketing between 2011 and 2016.</P>

<P>这个宣传方式在中国没有产生效果，联合利华的护肤产品助理经理露西亚・刘(Lucia Liu)说，她从2011年到2016年参与了舒耐(Rexona)的市场推广。</P>

<P>“The traditional thinking here is that sweating is good because it helps people detox,” said Ms. Liu. “There is a marketing barrier that is really hard to overcome.”</P>

<P>“在传统的观念里出汗是件好事，因为它会帮助排毒，”她说。“这个市场营销上的障碍很难克服。”</P>

<P>Indeed, Chinese health websites have long promoted the benefits of sweating, ranging from a boost in immunity to memory enhancement to skin rejuvenation. To many Chinese, perspiration is a natural part of metabolism that should not be blocked.</P>

<P>的确，中国的健康网站长期以来一直在宣传出汗的益处，从增强免疫力、提高记忆力到肌肤恢复活力。对于很多中国人而言，排汗是新陈代谢的自然组成部分，不应该被阻碍。</P>

<P>There’s another reason few Chinese consumers buy deodorant: basic biology.</P>

<P>很少有中国消费者购买香体露还有另一个原因：基本的生理特性。</P>

<P>Scientists in recent years have shown that many East Asians, a group that includes China’s ethnic Han majority, have a gene that lowers the likelihood of a strong “human axillary odor” ― scientist-speak for body stink.</P>

<P>科学家近年来已经证明，很多东亚人携带的一种基因可以降低产生强烈“人体腋窝气味”――体臭的科学说法――的可能性，这个群体包括占中国大多数的汉族人口。</P>

<P>That lowers the likelihood that they will use deodorant to begin with, according to a 2013 study by researchers at the University of Bristol and Brunel University in Britain, after a survey of nearly 6,500 women of various backgrounds.</P>

<P>这从根本上减少了他们使用香体露的可能性，英国布里斯托大学(University of Bristol)和布鲁内尔大学(Brunel University)的研究人员在2013年访问了近6500名来自不同背景的女性后得出了这样的结论。</P>

<P>“It is likely that deodorant usage is not widely adopted because there is, for much of the East Asia population, no need for it,” it said. (For those curious about such matters, that same genetic difference also leads to drier earwax.)</P>

<P>“香体露的使用不是非常普遍，这可能是因为，对于很多东亚人而言，他们不需要，”研究称。（还有一点――如果你对这类事情感兴趣――同样的基因差别也导致东亚人的耳垢更干燥。）</P>

<P>Unilever was not deterred. It deployed a range of traditional marketing tools, including signing top celebrities to appear in TV ads, in-store product sampling and sweat tests, and concert sponsorships.</P>

<P>联合利华没有因此却步。它使用了一系列传统市场推广手法，包括聘请最红的名人出现在电视广告中、店内产品试用和排汗测试，以及赞助演唱会等。</P>

<P>Many of its efforts seem tone deaf in retrospect.</P>

<P>如今看来，该公司许多的努力似乎都没有奏效。</P>

<P>A series of Rexona print ads portrayed a person’s armpits as potential threats to others. In one, a gunslinger ― his armpit hovering over the scene in the foreground ― appears to take down his opponent without touching his revolver. In a similar ad, a boxer appears to knock out his opponent with little more than his aroma.</P>

<P>一系列舒耐的平面广告刻画了一个人的腋窝成为他人的潜在威胁。在一则广告中，一名持枪劫匪的腋窝在画面前景摇晃，他似乎没有使用手枪就制服了对手。在另一个类似广告中，一名拳击手只靠自己的体香就击倒了对手。</P>

<P>Ng Tian It, a Singaporean creative director who oversaw the ad campaign, was proud of the look. But he said the ads appeared to be out of touch with many Chinese consumers unfamiliar with Old West shootouts, professional boxing and the prospect of offensive underarm smells.</P>

<P>主管这个广告系列的新加坡创意总监黄田一(Ng Tian It)对视觉效果感到很满意。但他说，这些广告似乎脱离了许多不熟悉美国西部枪战、职业拳击和冒犯性腋臭的中国消费者的生活。</P>

<P>“The series of advertisements we designed relied on the Western sense of humor,” he said. “Not many Chinese would understand this.”</P>

<P>“我们设计的这个系列的广告是基于西方的幽默，”他说。“很多中国人并不一定能明白。”</P>

<P>Deodorant sales in the United States reached $4.5 billion in 2016, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm. China’s total: $110 million. Deodorant also does not sell well in other East Asian markets: Japan’s sales that year were about one-tenth those of the United States.</P>

<P>根据市场调查公司欧睿(Euromonitor)的统计，香体露2016年在美国的销售额为45亿美元(约合288亿元人民币）。中国的销售额一共1.1亿美元(约合7亿元人民币）。香体露在其他东亚市场的销售也表现不佳：日本同年的销售额为美国的十分之一。</P>

<P>Companies hoping to sell deodorant in China have had to appeal to other senses. Nivea, a brand owned by Beiersdorf A.G. of Germany, has tried to lure female Chinese consumers by rolling out deodorants with whitening functions, to cater to a market where fair skin often confers social status.</P>

<P>希望在中国销售香体露的公司不得不从其他感官上想办法。德国拜尔斯道夫(Beiersdorf A.G.)集团旗下品牌妮维雅(Nivea)试图在香体露中加入美白功效来吸引中国女性消费者，以此来讨好一个白皙肤色往往表明社会地位的市场。</P>

<P>Simon Cao, Nivea’s China marketing director, said that the deodorant was popular but that “the room for growth is very limited.”</P>

<P>妮维雅中国区市场主管西蒙・曹(Simon Cao)说，香体露很受欢迎，但“增长空间非常有限”。</P>

<P>“We will not spend too much energy on deodorant, because the investment is not proportional to the return,” he said.</P>

<P>“我们不会在香体露上花太多精力，因为投入和回报是不成比例的，”他说。</P>

<P>The dearth of deodorants in China has forced some expatriates to hoard.</P>

<P>香体露在中国的稀缺迫使一些外国人不得不囤货。</P>

<P>Alex Stevens, a 26-year-old American former public relations professional who left Beijing last year after living there nearly a decade, said he loaded up on deodorant every time he was back in the United States.</P>

<P>26岁的美国人亚力克斯・史蒂芬斯(Alex Stevens)是一名前公关从业者，在北京生活了近十年，直到去年离开，他说他每次回到美国都会大量购入香体露。</P>

<P>“It’s really become the only thing I stock up on when I go back home,” he said, “and I don’t give any away to friends, not even for a price.”</P>

<P>“它已经变成了我回家时唯一会囤的东西，”他说。“而且我一个都不会送给朋友，就算他们花钱来买。”</P>

<P>Alibaba’s Online Growth Surges, Even as It Looks Offline<BR>阿里上季增长超预期，加速布局线下“新零售”</P>

<P>HONG KONG ― The Alibaba Group, the Chinese online shopping giant, has become so big that it is looking for growth by forging into new territory: the offline world.</P>

<P>香港――中国在线购物巨头阿里巴巴集团已经大到一定程度，以至于它要为寻求增长开拓线下市场这个新领域。</P>

<P>Alibaba has snapped up stakes in grocers and in an electronics chain over the past three years, a perhaps counterintuitive series of moves for a company that helps consumers in China buy products with their smartphones. In part, the push is driven by the eventual maturation of its online business.</P>

<P>在过去的三年里，阿里巴巴已经收购了食品百货店和一个电子产品连锁店的股份。对于这家帮助中国消费者用智能手机购物的公司来说，这也许是一个违反直觉的做法。这种做法在某种程度上受其在线业务的最终成熟所驱动。</P>

<P>For now, however, online shopping still rules the roost.</P>

<P>但就目前而言，网上购物仍是主宰。</P>

<P>Alibaba on Thursday reported a one-third rise in profit for the three months that ended in December, on revenue that rose by more than half. The revenue growth rate was its slowest in a year but still came in better than expected.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴周四公布了截至去年12月的第三季度财报，公司第三季度利润与一年前相比增长36%，营收增长50%以上。虽然营收增长速度是一年来最慢的，但仍好于预期。</P>

<P>广告<BR>Investors are betting that Alibaba’s run will continue. The company’s stock more than doubled last year, installing it firmly in the technology world’s major league. Alibaba’s market capitalization now exceeds half a trillion dollars, making it smaller than Alphabet and Amazon but comparable to Facebook and China’s other internet colossus, Tencent Holdings.</P>

<P>投资者押注阿里巴巴将继续成功。该公司的股票价格去年增长了一倍多，使之稳当地进入技术世界一流队伍的行列。阿里巴巴的市值现已超过5000亿美元，虽然不如Alphabet和亚马逊(Amazon)，但可与Facebook及中国另一家互联网巨头腾讯控股相提并论。</P>

<P>Still, a pullback in growth is inevitable for a company with Alibaba’s reach.</P>

<P>尽管如此，对阿里巴巴这样的公司而言，增长的回落是不可避免的。</P>

<P>The company will have a harder time finding Chinese consumers who aren’t already online. Smartphone sales are flattening out. Although economic growth still looks strong, Alibaba will have to work harder to rake in more revenue from its online marketplaces. Its other businesses outside retail, like online video and cloud computing, still lose money, and its overseas expansion hasn’t yet paid off.</P>

<P>公司将很难找到尚未上网的中国消费者。智能手机销量正趋于平稳。尽管经济增长看似依然强劲，但是，阿里巴巴要从其在线市场获得更多收入的话，将不得不作出更大的努力。公司在零售之外的其他业务，如在线视频和云计算上仍然亏损，其海外扩张也尚未带来回报。</P>

<P>The company has lifted its recent results by offering more and better services to the vendors on its platforms. But it is also eyeing the 84 percent of physical goods sales that still take place offline in China.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴通过为其平台上的供应商提供更多更好的服务提升了其最近的业绩。但公司的目光也在转向中国仍在线下进行的84%的实体商品销售。</P>

<P>Alibaba has been pouring cash into experiments in what its founder, Jack Ma, calls “new retail”: a kind of teched-up re-envisioning of how people shop in store. In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴正为在其创始人马云称之为“新零售”领域进行的试验投入大量现金。“新零售”指的是对人们如何在商店购物的一种基于技术的重新构想；特别地，它希望阿里巴巴收集更详细的用户数据，这将有助于公司为其线上和线下的客户提供更加个性化的服务和广告。</P>

<P>In that respect, the company has a head start on Amazon, which paid more than $13 billion for Whole Foods last year. In 2015, Alibaba struck a deal to buy a stake in Suning, an electronics retailer. It took control of Intime Retail, which runs department stores and malls, early last year. In November, it bought a $2.9 billion slice of Sun Art, one of China’s largest grocery operators.</P>

<P>在这方面，阿里巴巴走在了亚马逊的前面。亚马逊去年为收购全食超市(Whole Foods)支付了逾130亿美元。2015年，阿里巴巴与电子产品零售商苏宁达成协议，收购了后者的股份；去年年初，阿里巴巴买下了银泰(Intime Retail)，这家企业经营百货商场和购物中心等实体店；去年11月，阿里巴巴斥资29亿美元入股中国最大的大卖场运营商之一：高鑫(Sun Art)零售有限公司。</P>

<P>These brick-and-mortar partners are being fitted with Alibaba’s technology. At the same time, the company is building its own chain of stores, called Hema Xiansheng ― the name is a Chinese pun on “Mr. Hippopotamus” ― that combine a fresh-food market, a restaurant and facilities for home deliveries. Alibaba also debuted a cashier-free minimart last July ― well before Amazon opened its own automated convenience store last month.</P>

<P>这些实体合作伙伴正在配上阿里巴巴的技术。与此同时，阿里巴巴也在建立一个自己的连锁商店，店名是“盒马鲜生”，与“河马先生”谐音，这个连锁店将把生鲜食品市场、餐馆，以及提供住宅配送服务的设施结合起来。去年7月，阿里巴巴还开张了一家没有收银员的小超市，比亚马逊上个月开张的自己的全自动化便利商店早了好几个月。</P>

<P>“Some of Alibaba’s ‘new retail’ initiatives have shown quite promising signs of initial success,” said Jialong Shi, an analyst with Nomura, singling out Hema. Still, he said, “these initiatives may require a few more years of incubation before we can see profits.”</P>

<P>“阿里巴巴‘新零售’的一些举措已经显示出了相当有希望的初步成功迹象，”野村证券(Nomura)分析师史家龙说。不过，他表示，“在看到利润前，这些举措可能还需要几年的孵化期。”</P>

<P>Another challenge: Tencent, Alibaba’s biggest rival, is getting into fresh food and traditional retail, too.</P>

<P>另一个挑战是阿里巴巴最大的竞争对手腾讯，腾讯也在涉足生鲜食品和传统零售业。</P>

<P>Tencent is the world’s largest video game company. It also runs WeChat, China’s most popular messaging and social media app.</P>

<P>腾讯是全球最大的电子游戏公司，也是中国最流行的短信和社交媒体应用“微信”的运营商。</P>

<P>But Tencent is also charging into the old-fashioned shopping business. In December, it bought a stake in Yonghui Superstores, a large supermarket chain. It is weighing an investment in the China operations of Carrefour, the grocer and retailer headquartered in France. It is also leading the purchase of a $5.4 billion stake in Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties, a mall operator and part of the troubled Dalian Wanda conglomerate.</P>

<P>但腾讯也在向传统的购物行业进军。去年12月，腾讯收购了大型连锁超市永辉超市的股份。公司正在考虑对总部位于法国的食品百货零售商家乐福(Carrefour)的中国业务进行投资。此外，腾讯也是斥资340亿元人民币（约合54亿美元）收购大连万达商业地产股份的财团的牵头者。万达商业地产是陷入困境的大连万达集团的一部分，主要经营购物中心。</P>

<P>For now at least, analysts do not expect Alibaba and Tencent to end up owning rival alliances of stores. Tencent primarily seems to want to create more opportunities for people to use its mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. It is also hunting for new clients for its cloud computing business.</P>

<P>至少从目前来看，分析师们并不认为阿里巴巴和腾讯会最终拥有许多相互竞争的商店联合体。腾讯看来主要是想为人们创造更多的使用其移动支付服务“微信支付”的机会。腾讯也在为其云计算业务寻找新客户。</P>

<P>“It’s very hard for me to imagine that Tencent would fully own and operate a supermarket on its own,” Mr. Shi of Nomura said.</P>

<P>“我很难想象腾讯会靠自己的力量完全拥有并运营超市，”野村证券的史家龙说。</P>

<P>For both Alibaba and Tencent, though, creating more points of contact with their customers helps them amass more user data. This is one reason the companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, which helps them make sense of the boatloads of user information they are hauling in every minute.</P>

<P>但对阿里巴巴和腾讯来说，与其客户建立更多的接触点，可以帮助它们积累更多的用户数据。这也是这些公司正把大笔资金投入到人工智能方面的原因之一，人工智能帮助它们从时时刻刻都在采集的大量用户信息中得到有意思的信息。</P>

<P>“They not only have the largest data sets, but they have data sets tied to customers that they can identify,” Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, said. “The potential for A.I.-led monetization growth, we think, is still at a very early stage.”</P>

<P>“它们不仅拥有最大的数据集，还拥有与它们可识别的客户相联的数据集，”新街研究公司(New Street Research)分析师柯克・布德里(Kirk Boodry)说。“我们认为，人工智能带动的赚钱机会增长的潜力仍处于非常早期的阶段。”</P>

<P>Also on Thursday, Alibaba said it would acquire a one-third stake in the parent company of Alipay, one of China’s two main online payment services. The two sides agreed in 2014 to give Alibaba the right to acquire the stake. The two companies used to be one until Mr. Ma took the Alipay operations out and formed a separate company.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴在周四还宣布，将收购支付宝母公司三分之一的股份，支付宝是中国两大在线支付服务之一。双方曾在2014年达成赋予阿里巴巴收购股权的协议。在马云将支付宝的业务剥离出去并成立一家独立的公司之前，这两家公司曾经是一家。</P>

<P>Amazon Wants to Disrupt Health Care in America. In China, Tech Giants Already Have.<BR>中美科技巨头的“较量”：将技术运用于医保领域</P>

<P>BEIJING ― Amazon and two other American titans are trying to shake up health care by experimenting with their own employees’ coverage. By Chinese standards, they’re behind the curve.</P>

<P>北京――亚马逊(Amazon)和另外两家美国巨头正在试图通过试验自己员工的医保范围来改变医保现状。按照中国的标准，它们落后了。</P>

<P>Technology companies like Alibaba and Tencent have made health care a priority for years, and are using China as their laboratory. After testing online medical advice and drug tracking systems, they are now focused on a more advanced tool: artificial intelligence.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴和腾讯等科技公司多年来一直把医保放在优先地位，把中国当成自己的实验室。在试验了在线医疗咨询和药物追踪系统后，它们现在专注于一个更先进的工具：人工智能。</P>

<P>Their aggressive push underscores the differences between the health care systems in China and the United States.</P>

<P>他们的积极努力突显出中美两国医保制度的不同。</P>

<P>Chinese hospitals are overburdened, with just 1.5 doctors for every 1,000 people ― barely half the figure in the United States. Along with a rapidly aging population, China also has the largest number of obese children in the world, as well as more diabetes patients than anywhere else.</P>

<P>中国的医院负担过重，医患比例为1.5比1000，几乎是美国的一半。除了人口迅速老龄化，中国还拥有全世界人数最多的肥胖儿童和糖尿病患者。</P>

<P>The companies’ technological push is encouraged by the government. Beijing has said it wants to be a leader in A.I. by 2030 and pledged to take on the United States in the field. While officials have emphasized the use of artificial intelligence in areas like defense and self-driving cars, they have also aggressively promoted its use in health care.</P>

<P>这些公司的技术推进得到了政府的鼓励。北京已表示，它想在2030年前成为人工智能领域的领军者，并誓言要与美国在这一领域展开较量。尽管官员们强调在国防和无人驾驶汽车等领域使用人工智能，他们也积极推动它在医保领域的应用。</P>

<P>Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China’s e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴和腾讯已经成为中国电子商务和移动支付领域的领头羊，同时也站在人工智能领域的前沿。它们的目标包括：创造能够提高医生效率的诊断工具。</P>

<P>Amazon and its partners, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, see technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable medical services. Although the alliance is still in the early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices.</P>

<P>亚马逊及其合作伙伴摩根大通(JPMorgan Chase)和伯克希尔―哈撒韦公司(Berkshire Hathaway)将技术视为提供简化的、负担得起的医疗服务的一种方式。尽管该联盟尚处于起步阶段，但它可以创建在线医疗咨询服务，或者利用其整体影响力来协商降低药品价格。</P>

<P>“It’s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,” said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.</P>

<P>“公平地说，总体来讲，中国的科技公司都积极参与医疗保健领域，不像美国，有些公司积极，有些不积极，”伯恩斯坦研究公司(Bernstein Research)的亚太医保分析师劳拉・尼尔森・卡尼(Laura Nelson Carney)表示。</P>

<P>“Few of them have made moves as big as in China,” Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent’s American rivals.</P>

<P>“它们中很少有谁采取中国公司这么大的动作，”卡尼说。她指的是阿里巴巴和腾讯的美国竞争对手。</P>

<P>Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.</P>

<P>这些重大举措取得了不同程度的成功。</P>

<P>In 2014, Alibaba announced a “future hospital” plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba’s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.</P>

<P>2014年，阿里巴巴宣布了“未来医院”计划，患者可以在线咨询医生，并通过互联网订购药品，从而提高医疗效率。但两年后，中国的监管机构禁止阿里巴巴的电子商务网站天猫销售非处方药。他们还暂停了该公司创建的药物监控系统。去年，搜索引擎公司百度为了把精力集中在人工智能上，取消了自己的互联网医疗服务，该服务帮助患者通过一款应用程序预约医生。</P>

<P>But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba’s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.</P>

<P>不过，最近的一些举措已经取得了进展。去年，阿里巴巴的健康部门推出了一个可以帮助解释CT扫描结果的人工智能软件，以及一个可以协助医生进行诊断的人工智能医疗实验室。大约一个月后，腾讯公布了自己的医疗成像计划“觅影”，它帮助广西西南部地区的医生发现癌症的早期迹象。目前，中国有近百家医院在使用它。</P>

<P>Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba’s “future hospital” in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.</P>

<P>腾讯还投资了微医集团，该集团在中国西北部地区开设了自己的“未来医院”。患者可通过该服务与医生进行视频，并在线购买处方上的药。</P>

<P>Advances in artificial intelligence have already been transformative for China’s overworked doctors.</P>

<P>对于中国劳累过度的医生来说，人工智能的进步是变革性的。</P>

<P>Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient’s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.</P>

<P>北京协和医院的眼科医生于伟泓博士表示，过去，她常常要花两天时间分析病人的眼睛，仔细查看模糊的图像，与同事讨论她的发现，然后写报告。该医院目前正在试用的人工智能软件能极大加快她完成这些工作的速度。</P>

<P>“Now, you don’t even need a minute,” she said.</P>

<P>“现在，一分钟应该都不用，”她说。</P>

<P>The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China’s working-age population.</P>

<P>该软件由体素科技开发，该公司从腾讯和硅谷风险投资公司红杉资本(Sequoia capital)等处筹集了约2850万美元。它专门从事医学图像自动分析，帮助于伟泓这样的眼科医生筛查糖尿病视网膜病变，这是中国劳动适龄人口失明的主要原因。</P>

<P>There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country’s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.</P>

<P>在这里，每100万人只有20名眼科医生，是美国的三分之一。4月，北京宣布了一个宏伟的计划，要让中国1.1亿糖尿病患者接受眼科检查。</P>

<P>“It’s impossible for one person to read that many images,” said Dr. Yu.</P>

<P>“那不可能有人去读这么多的片子，”于博士说。</P>

<P>Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China’s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.</P>

<P>2016年，爷爷奶奶都是医生的丁晓伟在完成加州大学洛杉矶分校(UCLA)计算机科学博士学位三个月后创办了VoxelCloud。该公司在洛杉矶和中国的上海与苏州设有办事处，目前正在等待中国的药品监管机构批准五个CT扫描和视网膜疾病的诊断工具。</P>

<P>The sheer size of China’s population ― nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems ― provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn’t as strict as in the United States, either.</P>

<P>中国人口接近14亿，可为这些系统提供足够的影像。庞大的人口规模为人工智能的发展提供了一个潜在的优势。有利的条件还包括：中国不太关心隐私，这降低了收集数据的难度，从而使人工智能系统更加智能和高效。此外，中国的监管也不像美国那么严格。</P>

<P>In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China’s health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.</P>

<P>据设在北京的行业咨询机构亿欧智库称，目前总共有130多家企业在利用人工智能提高中国医疗保健系统的效率。其中既有阿里巴巴和腾讯这样的巨头，也有在国内领先的iFlyTek和大量小创业公司。iFlyTek发明的机器人通过了中国的医疗从业资格考试。</P>

<P>Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China’s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.</P>

<P>资金正在流入这个领域。据亿欧称，截至8月，红杉资本(Sequoia)和经纬创投(Matrix Partners)等风投机构已经在这类企业中投资了至少27亿美元。伯恩斯坦的分析师估计，到2020年，中国医疗科技行业的支出将达到1500亿美元。</P>

<P>Behind this push is a realization that the country’s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.</P>

<P>在这波浪潮的背后，是对中国的医疗保健系统正处于危机的认识。因为缺乏有效的初级护理系统，患者涌向大城市的医院，有时候露宿一晚只是为了治疗发烧。医生劳累过度，感到不满的病人和病人家属袭击医生的报道屡见不鲜。</P>

<P>Yunfeng, the personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invested in one company, Yitu, that hopes to address the shortfall of resources. Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.</P>

<P>阿里巴巴创始人马云个人的投资基金云峰投资了名为依图的公司。该公司希望解决资源短缺的问题，它正在与东部省份浙江最好的医疗机构浙江省人民医院合作，开发自动识别早期肺癌的软件。</P>

<P>While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.</P>

<P>尽管最初关注的是人脸识别，但依图已进入更复杂的影像识别领域，如癌症扫描。2012年离开阿里巴巴创立该公司的林晨曦说，他希望利用这项技术确保中国各地实现平等的医疗服务。</P>

<P>“In China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,” he said. “With this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.”</P>

<P>“在中国，医疗资源非常稀缺，而且分布不均，最好的资源集中在省会城市，”他说。“有了这个系统，如果能在乡镇医院使用，会大大改善就医体验。”</P>

<P>Trying to identify cancer nodes ― shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test ― is grueling work, and China’s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital’s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.</P>

<P>努力发现癌结节――四处移动的黑白斑点，看起来有点像罗夏测验――是一项艰苦的工作，而中国医生的时间和资源远少于美国和其他地方的同行。浙江省人民医院放射科主任龚向阳把这个过程比作工厂，过度劳累可能会造成体力不支和出错。</P>

<P>“We have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,” he said. “So we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.”</P>

<P>“我们每天要看大量影像，”他说。“所以我们欢迎技术，如果它能减轻压力，同时提高效率的话。”</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>Tesla’s Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History<BR>马斯克的小目标：特斯拉市值不上500亿不领薪</P>

<P>For the last several years, there has been speculation about Elon Musk’s future at Tesla, and whether he would step down as chief executive in the next year or two.</P>

<P>在过去的几年里，关于埃隆・马斯克(Elon Musk)在特斯拉(Tesla)的未来，以及他是否会在一两年内辞去首席执行官职务，坊间有许多猜测。</P>

<P>Musk stoked that speculation as far back as five years ago when he said he wanted to stay through the introduction of the Model 3. Then in 2014, he said, “I’ll have to see, you know, how things are going at that point,” adding, “I will certainly be the CEO for the next four or five years, and it’s TBD after that.”</P>

<P>马斯克早在五年前就引发了这样的猜测，当时他表示自己希望等到Model 3推出。而到了2014年，他说，“我得看看，到时候是什么情况，”还说，“往后的四五年我肯定都会是公司的CEO，之后再待定。”</P>

<P>With the success of Musk’s various other endeavors, such as Space X, his aeronautics company, it was only natural that investors would expect that the model for Robert Downey Jr.'s character in “Iron Man” might move on to a different role at Tesla.</P>

<P>随着马斯克的其他创业取得成功，比如他的航天公司Space X，投资者自然会想到，这位小罗伯特・唐尼(Robert Downey Jr.)在“钢铁侠”系列中的人物原型，可能会在特斯拉担负一个不同的角色。</P>

<P>Well, it is now four years later, the Model 3 had its debut last July (though production delays have slowed the rollout), and Musk’s to-be-determined declaration has been determined: He told me he had agreed to stay on as chief executive at Tesla for the next decade.</P>

<P>那么，现在四年过去了，Model 3在去年6月亮相（尽管生产进度滞后拖慢了它的发布），马斯克的待定声明也已确定：他告诉我，他已同意在未来十年内继续出任特斯拉的首席执行官。</P>

<P>The company is planning to announce on Tuesday Musk’s new compensation plan, and it is perhaps the most radical in corporate history: Musk will be paid only if he reaches a series of jaw-dropping milestones based on the company’s market value and operations. Otherwise, he will be paid nothing.</P>

<P>特斯拉计划在周二宣布马斯克新的薪酬计划，而这或许是企业史上最激进的计划：只有在公司市值和运营方面达到了一系列令人瞠目结舌的里程碑后，马斯克才能获得薪酬。否则，他将一无所获。</P>

<P>Tesla has set a dozen targets, each $50 billion more than the next, starting at $100 billion, then $150 billion, then $200 billion and so on, all the way to a market value of $650 billion. In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.</P>

<P>特斯拉设定了12个目标，每个目标都比上一个高出500亿美元，从1000亿美元开始，然后是1500亿，到2000亿，再继续往上，一直到6500亿美元的市值。此外，公司还设立了12个收入和调整后利润目标。只有在这两项皆达标后，他才能获得168万股，或大约公司1%的股权。</P>

<P>But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.</P>

<P>不过，为了更好地了解这些数字意味着什么，需要知道特斯拉今天的市值只有约590亿美元。</P>

<P>If Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion ― a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations ― his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic.). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.</P>

<P>如果马斯克设法将特斯拉的市值增加到6500亿美元――许多专家会认为这个数字不切实际到令人发笑――这家公司将排进美国企业前五，根据当前的估值――他的股票奖励可能价值550亿美元（若假设公司在未来十年内不再发行更多股票的话，而那是不现实的）。即使只实现了其中几个目标，他也能获得数十亿美元。</P>

<P>Musk’s critics ― and there are many ― are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company’s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla’s shares ― and has been on the losing side of that trade ― has contended that Tesla is worthless.</P>

<P>马斯克的批评者――这是个不小的群体――很可能会将这个新的薪酬方案看作是公司最新的公关噱头。他被称为当代P・T・巴纳姆(P.T. Barnum)，在产量达不到预期的情况下，还是能制造成功的幻觉。公司持续亏损，据彭博新闻社(Bloomberg News)报道，去年的亏损一度达到将近每小时50万美元。空头吉姆・查诺斯(Jim Chanos)做空了特斯拉的股票――截止目前他还是输家――并认为特斯拉一文不值。</P>

<P>But Musk’s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it’s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.</P>

<P>但马斯克的薪酬计划并非假象：只有公司长期成功且市值有显著提高，他才能获得薪酬。而通过短期哄抬股价操纵这个体制，对他来说则是不可能的。根据商定的条款，即使他获得股份，也必须额外持有五年才能出售。</P>

<P>The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.</P>

<P>这样的安排使每一个里程碑都成了一个硬指标：他要么做到，要么一无所获。</P>

<P>“If all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla’s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,” he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)</P>

<P>“如果在未来十年内，特斯拉的市值只有80%或90%的增长，那么我的薪酬总额将为零，”他说。（他的计算基于今年起始的股价，当时公司价值500亿美元。）</P>

<P>Still, he contended, “I actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.”</P>

<P>不过，他认为，“我真的能看到特斯拉在十年时间内变成一个万亿美元公司的潜力。”</P>

<P>As executive compensation plans go, Tesla’s is about as friendly to shareholders as they come. Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.</P>

<P>在高管薪酬方案上，特斯拉格外考虑股东利益。很多公司实施的巨额方案往往是以股东的权益为代价，因为高管即使表现得不及同行，也会拿到报酬。</P>

<P>Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Musk’s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla’s compensation committee, told me, “It’s heads you win, tails you don’t lose,” meaning if Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.</P>

<P>被问到股东应该会对马斯克的薪酬待遇作何感想时，特斯拉薪酬委员会主席艾拉・埃伦普拉斯(Ira Ehrenpreis)告诉我，“这是硬币正面算你赢，背面你也不会输”。也就是说，如果马斯克赚了几百亿美元，那么股东是赢家；如果马斯克表现不佳，股东也不损失什么。</P>

<P>Musk’s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could conceive Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.</P>

<P>马斯克的薪酬方案与公司在2012年价值32亿美元时实行的一个计划类似。只是现在，相关的数字大大增加了。那个计划也规定，只有在达到特定的市值和营业基本标准后，马斯克才能领取报酬。几乎没人想到特斯拉的市值会发展到那时的17倍。</P>

<P>Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.</P>

<P>该计划列出的所有标准马斯克都达到了，只有一项除外。</P>

<P>Even though Musk’s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.</P>

<P>尽管马斯克的股份已经兑现，但他没有卖出股份，为了交拨款的税除外。他当前持有的股份价值130亿美元。</P>

<P>Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?</P>

<P>马斯克常常说，自己的动力不是赚钱。那么这个激励方案吸引他的地方是什么呢？</P>

<P>“None of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,” he said. “The reason that it’s important to me personally is that there’s some pretty big things that I want to do.”</P>

<P>“完全不是为了创造富可敌国的财富，”他说。“原因在于，对我个人来说很重要的是，我想做一些非常重大的事情。”</P>

<P>“I want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,” he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. “That obviously requires a certain amount of capital.”</P>

<P>“我希望为人类成为一个分布在多个星球上的物种做出尽可能多的贡献，”他提到了经常谈论的一个目标，包括让人类在火星上生活。“这显然需要一定的资金。”</P>

<P>Chinese Carmaker May Use Fiat Chrysler for Foothold in United States<BR>中国车企进军美国，广汽计划2019年在美售车</P>

<P>DETROIT ― For years, as China emerged as the world’s largest producer of automobiles, American car companies have wondered when a Chinese manufacturer would try to enter the United States market.</P>

<P>底特律――多年来，随着中国成为世界上最大的汽车生产国，美国汽车公司一直想知道，中国制造商何时会试图进入美国市场。</P>

<P>Now they have an answer: 2019.</P>

<P>现在他们有了答案：2019年。</P>

<P>At the Detroit auto show on Monday, officials of GAC Motor, based in Guangzhou, outlined a broad plan to build up its operations in the United States and begin selling a vehicle here next year, possibly in partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</P>

<P>在周一的底特律车展上，总部设在广州的广汽乘用车公司(GAC Motor)的高管介绍了公司在美国开展业务的广泛计划。该公司计划于明年开始在这里销售汽车，可能是通过与菲亚特克莱斯勒汽车公司(Fiat Chrysler Automobiles)合作的形式。</P>

<P>GAC also expects to open a development center in Michigan and a design center in Los Angeles in the first half of this year, the executives said. The company had already established a technology lab in Silicon Valley last year.</P>

<P>高管表示，广汽还计划于今年上半年在密歇根开设一个研发中心，并在洛杉矶成立一个设计中心。公司去年已在硅谷建立了一个技术实验室。</P>

<P>“We intend to gain a foothold in the U.S.,” Yu Jun, GAC Motor’s president, said at a news conference. “If we can make it in the U.S., we can make it anywhere and enhance further possibilities of future growth.”</P>

<P>“我们打算在美国获得一个立脚点，”广汽集团总裁郁俊在新闻发布会上说。“如果我们能在美国获得成功，我们就可以在任何地方获得成功，这将给未来的增长带来更多的可能性。”</P>

<P>GAC ― which sold about 500,000 vehicles last year and markets several models under the name Trumpchi ― is considering selling its car through dealerships tied to Fiat Chrysler. The two companies are already partners in China, where GAC manufactures Jeeps for the Italian-American automaker.</P>

<P>广汽去年售出了约50万辆汽车，包括型号为传祺(Trumpchi)的几款汽车。公司正考虑用菲亚特克莱斯勒的经销商来销售自己的汽车。这两家公司已经在中国有合作关系，广汽为这家意大利-美国汽车制造商生产吉普车。</P>

<P>“In the first half of this year, we will establish a North American sales company that will be responsible for developing the dealership network,” Mr. Jun said. “We will explore all sorts of channels including partnering with F.C.A. as well as others.”</P>

<P>“今年上半年，我们将建立一个北美销售公司，负责发展经销网络，”郁俊说。“我们将探索各种渠道，包括与菲亚特克莱斯勒以及其他厂家的合作。”</P>

<P>Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler’s chief executive, said his company was ready to assist GAC. “We are talking to them about how and if we can help if they come to the U.S.,” Mr. Marchionne told reporters at his own news conference earlier in the day.</P>

<P>菲亚特克莱斯勒首席执行官塞尔焦・马尔基翁内(Sergio Marchionne)表示，他的公司已经准备好为广汽提供帮助。“我们正在就如果他们来美国，我们如何帮助、是否能提供帮助等问题与他们展开讨论。”马尔基翁内当天早些时候在他召开的新闻发布会上对记者说。</P>

<P>The potential for cooperation in the United States is sure to fuel further speculation about whether the two companies will move toward an even closer alliance. Fiat Chrysler has been in discussions with a number of Chinese companies about potential equity investments, a prospect that took on greater significance after Mr. Marchionne tried and failed to persuade General Motors to consider merging with his company in 2015.</P>

<P>在美国进行合作的潜在可能，必定会引发关于这两家企业是否会走向更紧密联盟的进一步猜测。菲亚特克莱斯勒一直在与几家中国公司讨论可能的股权投资事宜；在马尔基翁内试图在2015年说服通用汽车(General Motors)公司考虑与他的公司合并未获成功后，这个问题的意义变得更为重大。</P>

<P>Mr. Marchionne has said he hopes to merge or partner with another automaker to improve Fiat Chrysler’s long-term prospects as technology and new global markets reshape the industry. While the company is profitable, it has not earned enough to make significant investments in the kind of technologies that appear crucial to the future of the industry, such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars.</P>

<P>马尔基翁内一直表示，他希望与另一家汽车制造商合并或合作，以在技术和新的全球市场重塑汽车行业的时候，改善菲亚特克莱斯勒的长期前景。尽管公司仍在盈利，但其并没有赚到足够多的钱，来投资那些对汽车行业未来至关重要的技术，比如电动汽车和自动驾驶汽车。</P>

<P>Whether or not his company enters a partnership with GAC or another company, Mr. Marchionne will probably not be around to see if it pays off. During his news conference, he confirmed that this will be his last year running Fiat Chrysler. He began as the chief executive of Fiat in 2004 and under his direction the company took control of Chrysler just as it was undergoing a wrenching bankruptcy reorganization engineered by regulators in Washington in 2009.</P>

<P>无论他的公司是否与广汽或其他公司建立合作关系，马尔基翁内很可能不会看到这种关系是否会产生效益。他在新闻发布会上证实，这将是他掌管菲亚特克莱斯勒公司的最后一年。他于2004年起担任菲亚特的首席执行官，在他的管理下，公司于2009年接管了克莱斯勒，当时克莱斯勒正在华盛顿的监管机构的策划下进行痛苦的破产重组。</P>

<P>Mr. Marchionne said his successor will be named sometime after March, when Fiat Chrysler expected to present a new business plan that will serve as a road map to guide the company’s operations through 2022. Two internal candidates, Richard Palmer, the chief financial officer, and Mike Manley, head of the highly profitable Jeep and Ram brands, are expected to be among the top contenders.</P>

<P>马尔基翁内表示，继任他的人选将在今年3月后公布，预计届时菲亚特克莱斯勒将展示一份新的商业计划，作为指导公司从现在起到2022年的经营路线图。人们预计最热门的竞争人选包括两名内部候选人，包括首席财务官理查德・帕尔默(Richard Palmer)以及非常赚钱的吉普(Jeep)和公羊(Ram)品牌的负责人迈克・曼利(Mike Manley)。</P>

<P>Mr. Marchionne said that Fiat Chrysler “has no intention” of breaking up the company and selling Jeep or Ram. “The answer is no,” he said.</P>

<P>马尔基翁内表示，菲亚特克莱斯勒“没有打算”将公司分拆，出售吉普或公羊品牌。“答案是否定的，”他说。</P>

<P>But a partnership to sell GAC cars in the United States could make sense. Fiat Chrysler’s Dodge and Chrysler brands no longer offer small or mid-sized cars, having dropped them from their lineups in 2016. Dealers selling Fiat-brand small cars, meanwhile, are desperate for additional models to offer. Many Fiat dealers sell only a handful of new cars each month and do most of their business in a variety of used models.</P>

<P>但是，在美国销售广汽汽车的合作关系有其合理性。菲亚特克莱斯勒的道奇(Dodge)和克莱斯勒(Chrysler)品牌不再生产小型或中型轿车，公司已在2016年将这些型号从生产线上撤下。与此同时，销售菲亚特品牌小型汽车的经销商迫切希望能提供更多的车型。许多菲亚特经销商每月只销售少量新车，大部分业务都在各种各样的二手车型号上。</P>

<P>“Fiat has limited potential in the U.S.,” Mr. Marchionne acknowledged.</P>

<P>“菲亚特在美国的潜力有限，”马尔基翁内承认。</P>

<P>Furthermore, Fiat Chrysler does not have an electric car in its lineup and Mr. Marchionne opposes the idea of investing the money to develop one.</P>

<P>此外，菲亚特克莱斯勒的产品阵容中没有电动汽车，马尔基翁内反对投资研发这种汽车。</P>

<P>“I don’t know of any organization making money on electric vehicles,” he said. Hybrids and electric cars together make up only 3 percent of all new cars sold in the United States, he noted. “That is not a good economic basis in which to do any type of investment.”</P>

<P>“我不知道哪家企业在电动汽车上赚钱，”他说。混合动力车和电动汽车仅占美国新车销量的3%，他指出。“这不是进行任何类型投资的良好经济基础。”</P>

<P>Some dealers, however, said they saw a need for Fiat Chrysler to get back into the mid-sized car segment and offer at least one electric model. “It may be a shrinking segment but I still have customers who want cars,” said Wesley Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich. “And it would be nice to at least have one hybrid and electric vehicle because you do have those green customers out there.”</P>

<P>但一些经销商表示，他们认为菲亚特克莱斯勒需要重新进入中型轿车市场，并推出至少一款电动汽车车型。“这也许是一个不断缩小的细分市场，但我仍有想买电动汽车的顾客，”密歇根州杰克逊的“极端道奇”(Extreme Dodge)经销商老板韦斯利・卢茨(Wesley Lutz)说。“至少有一款混合动力和电动汽车，那会好得多，因为确实有些环保客户想买这种车。”</P>

<P>The first model GAC plans to offer in the United States is sport-utility vehicle called the GS8. The engineering center that GAC plans to build in or near Detroit would help design two additional models that the company plans to introduce in America, Mr. Jun said.</P>

<P>广汽计划在美国推出的第一款车型是名为GS8的SUV。郁俊说，广汽计划在底特律或其附近建立的工程中心，将帮助设计另外两款公司打算在美国推出的车型。</P>

<P>Two models that GAC showed off in Detroit were making their only stateside appearance. A small car, called the GA4, and a concept for an all-electric S.U.V. called the Enverge that Mr. Jun said has a 370-mile range, do not figure in the company’s United States plans.</P>

<P>广汽在底特律车展上展示的两款车型仅仅是在美国亮相。名为“GA4”的小型轿车以及名为“Enverge”的全电动SUV不在公司的美国计划中，郁俊说，这款电动汽车一次充电后的里程为370英里（合600公里）。</P>

<P>CES 2018: What the Gadget Fest Looks Like in ‘the Year of A.I.’<BR>“A.I.之年”：2018消费者电子产品展亮点</P>

<P>And many new products were unveiled. Samsung highlighted a smart refrigerator with a large touch screen and voice controls. Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer, showed its first high-end smartphone for the United States. And LG demonstrated a TV that can be rolled up like a yoga mat.</P>

<P>展会有许多新展品亮相。三星(Samsung)重点推出了有大触控屏的声控智能冰箱。中国制造商华为展出了公司首款面向美国市场的高端智能手机。而LG则展示了一台可以像瑜伽垫一样被卷起来的电视。</P>

<P>Yet the clear darling of this year’s show was not a gadget but the growing amount of artificial intelligence software helping these products run. The race between Amazon and Google to be the go-to service for integration of consumer products was on full display. In many booths, signs prominently advertised that products worked with Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa. The smart home, car and TV all seemed to have been touched by Amazon or Google.</P>

<P>但今年展会的宠儿显然不是某一个设备，而是数量越来越多的帮助这些产品运行的人工智能软件。亚马逊和谷歌为了成为消费者产品一体化首选服务而展开的竞赛，在这里有充分体现。许多展台上招牌都醒目地打出了产品是与谷歌助手(Google Assistant)还是亚马逊Alexa合作。智能家庭、汽车和电视上似乎都有亚马逊或谷歌的痕迹。</P>

<P>“It’s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,” said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.</P>

<P>“这是人工智能和对话界面之年，”弗雷斯特研究公司(Forrester Research)分析师J・P・高恩德(J. P. Gownder)说。</P>

<P>Zipping along the convention floor were robots yielding a host of skills. One robot, Nimbo, works as an intelligent security system that can be programmed to patrol specific routes. Another robot, iPal, serves as companion to older and younger users. Designed by AvatarMind, the $1,500 humanoid robot can remind elders to take medicine or greet children at the door.</P>

<P>掌握各种技能的机器人在会场上鱼贯而过。其中一个叫Nimbo的机器人是一个智能安全系统，可以在设定的特定路线巡逻。另一个叫“i宝”(iPal)的机器人可以用作老人和小孩的伙伴。阿凡达机器人(AvatarMind)设计的这个价值1500美元的人形机器人可以提醒老人吃药，或是在门口迎接小孩。</P>

<P>Sony’s new robot dog, Aibo, also stopped conventiongoers who took time to rub their hands on its hard-surface head.</P>

<P>索尼(Sony)的新机器狗Aibo也会让参会者驻足，花些时间伸手摸摸它们表面坚硬的脑袋。</P>

<P>Google’s presence was easily identifiable with activation centers, games and presenters walking around the convention floor, but Amazon dominated the arena by the sheer volume of products that worked with the Alexa voice assistant, like robovacuums, light dimmers and even mosquito zappers.</P>

<P>从激活中心、游戏到在展会大厅里四处走动的讲者，谷歌的存在可以很明显感受到，但亚马逊借大量与Alexa语音小助手合作的产品主导了赛场，如扫地机器人、调光设备，甚至还有灭蚊器。</P>

<P>Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World’s Computers<BR>芯片安全曝重大隐患，影响波及全球电脑</P>

<P>SAN FRANCISCO ― Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world’s computers.</P>

<P>旧金山――计算机安全专家在全世界几乎所有电脑都装有的微处理器中发现了两个重大安全漏洞。</P>

<P>The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers, servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.</P>

<P>这两个被命名为“Meltdown”（崩溃）和“Spectre”（幽灵）的漏洞允许黑客窃取计算机的全部内存内容，包括移动设备、个人计算机，以及在所谓的云计算机网络中运行的服务器。</P>

<P>There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent ― an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.</P>

<P>据研究人员称，Spectre没有简单的解决方案，或许还需要重新设计处理器；至于Meltdown，解决这个问题所需的软件补丁可能会使计算机运行速度下降30%――对于已经习惯从最喜欢的在线服务器上快速下载的人来说，这是一个尴尬的境地。</P>

<P>“What actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,” said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.</P>

<P>“各个漏洞的具体情况不同，解决方法也会不一样，”保罗・科克(Paul Kocher)说。科克曾是一个研究团队的重要成员，漏洞就是由这个团队发现的，该团队的研究人员都来自于谷歌、Rambus这样的大型科技公司或学术界。</P>

<P>Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.</P>

<P>Meltdown是亚马逊、谷歌、微软等公司提供的云计算服务的特有问题。周三晚上，谷歌和微软表示他们已经升级了系统以解决漏洞。</P>

<P>Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability “has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.” It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of AWS and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.</P>

<P>亚马逊告知使用亚马逊网络服务（Amazon Web Services，简称AWS）云服务的用户，称该漏洞“在现代处理器架构中已经存在了20多年”，并表示他们已经对AWS进行了全面防护，用户也必须升级自己在这些云服务上运行的软件。</P>

<P>To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.</P>

<P>要利用Meltdown，黑客可以像其他商业客户一样租用云服务空间。一旦他们登入服务器，漏洞便可以让他们获取其他用户的信息，比如密码。</P>

<P>That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers ― and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers’ data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.</P>

<P>这对云计算系统的运行方式来说是一个重大威胁。云服务往往会在多个用户之间共享计算机――而比如单个服务器只服务于单一客户的情况并不常见。尽管有旨在分离用户数据的安全工具和协议，但近期发现的芯片漏洞会使恶意使用者得以绕开这些保护措施。</P>

<P>The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.</P>

<P>用户使用的个人计算机也容易受到攻击，但黑客得首先想办法在个人计算机上运行软件，才有途径获取计算机的其他信息。这有多种实现方式：攻击者可以诱骗用户从邮件、应用商店，或通过访问受病毒感染的网站来下载软件。</P>

<P>According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.</P>

<P>据研究人员称，Meltdown漏洞差不多影响了英特尔(Intel)生产的所有微处理器，而这些作为互联网和私人业务运营基础的计算机服务器，有90%都在使用英特尔制造的芯片。</P>

<P>Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.</P>

<P>Windows操作系统的生产商微软(Microsoft)的用户想解决这个问题需要安装公司提供的升级；Linux则运行着全球30%的计算机服务器，监管着Linux开源操作系统的世界程序员社区已为该系统发布了补丁；苹果公司也部分修复了这个问题，并预计会另外再发布一个更新。</P>

<P>The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.</P>

<P>已对新的Linux代码进行了测试的独立软件开发人员安德烈斯・弗洛因德(Andres Freund)说，软件补丁可能会使受影响的计算机性能降低20%到30%。发现这两个漏洞的研究人员表达了类似的担忧。</P>

<P>This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.</P>

<P>这可能会成为所有通过云系统运行网站和其他软件的企业面临的一个大问题。</P>

<P>There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability ― at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.</P>

<P>没有证据表明这个漏洞已被黑客利用，至少目前还没有。但一旦一个安全问题被公开，计算机用户如果不安装解决这个问题的补丁，就会面临很大的风险。去年世界各地的计算机遭受的那场所谓的勒索软件攻击，就是利用了没有收到补丁的计算机，当时那个补丁针对的是Windows软件中的一个漏洞。</P>

<P>The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.</P>

<P>另一个漏洞Spectre会影响目前正在使用的大部分处理器，但研究人员认为，利用这个漏洞的难度更大。还没有已知的解决办法，并且不清楚英特尔等芯片制造商会采取什么措施解决这个问题。</P>

<P>It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel’s business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.</P>

<P>尚不确定这些芯片问题的曝光会对英特尔的业务产生什么影响。周三当天，这家硅谷巨头对这个问题轻描淡写。</P>

<P>“Intel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,” the company said in a statement. “Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.”</P>

<P>“英特尔和其他科技公司已知悉新的安全研究。相关研究介绍了一些如果用于恶意目的，便有可能从正常运行的计算设备不当收集敏感数据的软件分析方法，”该公司在一份声明中说。“英特尔认为，这些漏洞不具备破坏、修改或删除数据的潜力。”</P>

<P>Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.</P>

<P>解决Spectre的问题远不像发布一个软件补丁这么简单。</P>

<P>The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel’s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.</P>

<P>Meltdown漏洞是英特尔特有的，但Spectre是很多处理器制造商用了数十年的设计中出现的漏洞。它几乎会影响市场上的所有微处理器，包括设计与英特尔相同的AMD芯片，以及很多基于英国的ARM的设计制造的芯片。</P>

<P>Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is “going to live with us for decades,” said Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.</P>

<P>Spectre这个问题出现在设计处理器的基本方式上，它的威胁“会伴随我们几十年，”Rambus的密码学研究部门负责人兼首席科学家科克说。</P>

<P>“Whereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,” Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.</P>

<P>“Meltdown是一场紧急危机，但Spectre 影响的是几乎所高速微处理器，”科克说。他表示，设计新芯片时对速度的强调导致它们容易出现安全问题。</P>

<P>“We’ve really screwed up,” Kocher said. “There’s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.”</P>

<P>“我们真的搞砸了，”科克说。“整个行业一直希望越快越好，同时做到安全。Spectre表明，鱼和熊掌不可兼得。”</P>

<P>A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.</P>

<P>可能要到新一代芯片进入市场，才能找到解决Spectre的办法。</P>

<P>“This will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It’s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,” Kocher said. “It’s going to take a while.”</P>

<P>“这是一个会随着硬件的生命周期不断恶化的问题。不是一天两天就能改变的，”科克说。“要花一段时间。”</P>

<P>Made in China: New and Potentially Lifesaving Drugs<BR>癌症新药，中国制造</P>

<P>多年来，中国的制药业一直把注意力集中在仿制西药上。让新药获得批准是一个令人沮丧且耗时的过程。企业认为，将数百万美元投入药物研发风险大，不如把精力放在更安全的收入来源上。</P>

<P>The country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research.</P>

<P>现在，中国正努力在全球制药业发挥更大的作用。中国有数百万癌症或糖尿病患者，政府已把创新药物作为国家重点。官员已承诺加快药品审批速度，为了扭转人才外流，还在大力吸引科学家回国工作。当局为研发提供土地、拨款、税收减免以及投资。</P>

<P>The three new drugs will have to clear American regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China’s growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country’s economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors.</P>

<P>这三种新药仍需通过美国监管这道难关。如果通过的话，它们将成为中国生产前沿疗法的能力越来越强的证明，提高这种能力是中国经济向高附加值及日益复杂的行业进行更大范围转型的一部分。</P>

<P>China’s drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China’s medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.</P>

<P>与更大范围的工业相比，中国的药物研发仍处于早期阶段。但一些专家说，中国制药企业与辉瑞(Pfizer)和阿斯利康(AstraZeneca)这些制药巨头平起平坐只是时间问题。</P>

<P>“It’s not whether they are going to,” said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health care investment fund. “They are going to.”</P>

<P>“这不是他们做得到、做不到的问题，”医疗投资基金奥博亚洲(OrbiMed Asia)的资深董事总经理王健说。“他们一定能做到。”</P>

<P>For now, access to quality drugs remains a problem in China. Many people buy medicines from Hong Kong and Macau ― territories governed by separate laws. Online forums are devoted to discussing smuggling generics from India. Others buy the raw ingredients to make the drugs at home. Those who can afford it fly to the United States.</P>

<P>直到现在，在中国得到高质量的药品仍是个问题。许多人从香港和澳门购买药物，港澳地区受不同的法律管辖；网上有专门讨论从印度走私仿制药的论坛；还有人购买原材料在自己家里制药；出得起这笔钱的人飞到美国去看病。</P>

<P>A growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs.</P>

<P>越来越多的公司正在试图解决药品短缺的问题。得到香港首富李嘉诚支持的和黄中国医药科技(Hutchison China MediTech)2000年成立时曾尝试过中草药的开发。2005年，和黄医药开始研发抗癌药物。</P>

<P>At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs.</P>

<P>在上海的主要实验室里有多达350名科学家，他们被测试室中的啮齿类动物环绕着。半数以上的科学家正在努力寻找新药。</P>

<P>In October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60 percent of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib ― the first drug of its kind ― can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread.</P>

<P>去年10月，和黄医药报告说，在二期临床试验中，60%以上的患者对公司与阿斯利康共同研发的savolitinib有积极反应。Savolitinib是首种可用于治疗肺癌、肾癌、胃癌和结肠直肠癌的药物，通常与阿斯利康的其他药物一起使用，把允许癌症扩散的信号传导通路阻断掉。</P>

<P>Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration.</P>

<P>和黄医药正在等待更多的数据。如果进一步试验有积极的结果，公司将申请美国食品和药物管理局（简称FDA）所谓的突破性疗法认定。</P>

<P>It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the F.D.A., but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients.</P>

<P>公司仍需要做第三期临床试验，这是得到FDA全面批准之前的最后一步，但突破性疗法认定可缩短这个最后阶段的时间。第三期临床试验需要在多达几千名的患者身上检验被测试药物的安全性和有效性，通常是与安慰剂做对照。</P>

<P>Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, said that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70 percent.</P>

<P>伯恩斯坦研究公司(Bernstein Research)亚太医疗行业分析师劳拉・纳尔逊・卡尼(Laura Nelson Carney)说，第三期临床试验的成功率从行业平均水平来看是60%到70%。</P>

<P>If all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, said Christian Hogg, Chi-Med’s chief executive. “It takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he said.</P>

<P>如果一切都按计划顺利进行，监管部门最早可能在2019年底批准，和黄医药首席执行官贺隽(Christian Hogg)说。“花了20年的时间，才能突然成功，这就是我们此刻的情况，”他说。</P>

<P>The last time China produced a new drug for the global pharmaceutical industry was in the 1970s, when the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was credited with the discovery of artemisinin after Mao Zedong asked her to come up with a cure for malaria. But global recognition did not come until much later, after the Swiss drug maker Novartis bought the Chinese patent and started producing it in the late 1990s. Ms. Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in 2015.</P>

<P>中国上次为全球制药业开发出新药是在1970年代。在毛泽东号召中国科学家研发新的治疗疟疾药物之后，发现青蒿素的功劳归给了屠呦呦。但是，青蒿素在很多年后才得到全球的认可，那是在瑞士制药公司诺华(Novartis)在1990年代末购买了中国专利、开始生产该药之后。屠呦呦最终在2015年获得了诺贝尔奖。</P>

<P>That is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumors. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs.</P>

<P>这一切都在改变。除了和黄医药，另一家名为百济神州(BeiGene)的公司已在对两种药物在全球进行第三期临床试验，一种是用于治疗一种最常见的血癌、淋巴瘤的药物，另一种是以消灭肿瘤为目的的免疫治疗药物。百济神州还在与赛尔基因(Celgene)和默克公司(Merck)合作开发抗癌药物。</P>

<P>Ms. Carney said she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the United States, the world’s biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she said, based on current pricing patterns in China.</P>

<P>卡尼说，她预计在未来五年内，将有20或30个中国制造的药物在美国申请进行第三期临床试验。美国是世界上最大的抗癌药物市场。她说，从中国目前的定价模式来看，那些试验成功、获得批准的药物很可能会比外国公司生产的药物价格更低。</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Big Pharma is setting up its own labs here. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centers in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents.</P>

<P>与此同时，大型制药企业纷纷在中国建立自己的实验室。强生(Johnson &amp; Johnson)、诺华和赛诺菲(Sanofi)都已经在上海成立了为中国患者制药的研究中心。高管表示，中国政府已经在加强保护制药专利方面取得了进展。</P>

<P>And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the United States is typically 30 days.</P>

<P>批准的步伐也已加快。在最糟糕的情况下，制药公司需要等两年，才获得开启临床试验的批准，临床试验本身需要几年的时间。在美国，获得临床试验批准的等待期通常是30天。</P>

<P>Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China’s Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials.</P>

<P>2015年，毕井泉被任命为中国食品药品监督管理局局长，在他的领导下，中国药监局已经开始打击生产低质量药物的公司，并同意接受国外的临床试验数据。</P>

<P>Now, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China.</P>

<P>由于发生了这些转变，加上政府提供的激励措施，现在，在海外受过训练的科学家正在回国工作。</P>

<P>After 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park.</P>

<P>2011年，在美国的礼来公司(Eli Lilly)和辉瑞公司工作了20年之后，申华琼(Joan Shen)回到上海，领导辉瑞的临床试验部门。她现在负责中国生物技术公司泰康生物(I-Mab Biopharma)的研发工作。当地政府帮助这家公司获得了资金，并在一个高技术园区为公司提供了实验室空间。</P>

<P>“The funds are chasing us,” she said, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, “instead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors.”</P>

<P>申华琼在比较中美两国的投资环境时说，“这里是钱来找我们，而不是需要我们花大量时间去说服投资者。”</P>

<P>Despite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the United States is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research.</P>

<P>尽管前景乐观，但想要走出国内的中国制药公司仍面临着障碍。在美国这样的主要市场，制药公司之间的竞争十分激烈，中国企业尤其受到缺少研究资金的妨碍。</P>

<P>Jiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016.</P>

<P>中国公司江苏恒瑞医药目前正在从生产仿制药向开发新药转型，这家公司的研究预算是所有中国制药公司中最大的。但与辉瑞2016年花费的78亿美元的年度研究支出相比，江苏恒瑞1.8亿美元的年度研究支出相形见绌。</P>

<P>Still, with several drugs in early-stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company’s head of research and development, described as its “ultimate goal”: regulatory approval in the United States.</P>

<P>尽管如此，恒瑞医药已有几种进入早期试验的药物。用研发主管张连山的话说，公司的“最终目标”是获得美国监管部门的批准。</P>

<P>“If you have a drug approved by the U.S. F.D.A.,” Mr. Zhang said, “that’s a true demonstration of innovation.”</P>

<P>张连山说，“如果你有一个得到美国FDA批准的药物，那才是创新的真正表现。”</P>

<P>Accused of Slowing Old iPhones, Apple Offers Battery Discounts<BR>苹果为“降速门”致歉，降低更换电池价格</P>

<P>Facing a barrage of criticism after acknowledging the existence of a feature that can reduce the processing power of old iPhones, Apple said Thursday that it would reduce the price of battery replacements to regain customers’ trust.</P>

<P>承认存在降低旧iPhone处理能力的功能后，遭受一连串批评的苹果在周四表示，为了重新获得消费者的信任，该公司将为更换电池的服务减价。</P>

<P>The company’s mea culpa came just eight days after Apple said it had released a feature about a year ago meant to help prevent older devices ― such as iPhone 6 models and iPhone SE ― from unexpectedly shutting down.</P>

<P>苹果此番承认过失的八天前，它表示曾在约一年前推出一项功能，帮助防止旧款设备――比如iPhone 6系列和iPhone SE――突然关机。</P>

<P>The reduction of processing power, Apple said, was necessary because older batteries could otherwise periodically overload.</P>

<P>苹果说，降低设备的处理能力是必要的，因为不这么做的话，老款设备的电池会经常超负荷。</P>

<P>But some users saw Apple’s revelation as vindication of their longstanding belief that the company had been purposely slowing down old iPhones to get them to buy new ones.</P>

<P>但一些用户长期认为苹果有意降低旧款iPhone的速度，好让他们买新款，这些用户将苹果的披露视为对此说法的证实。</P>

<P>In its statement on Thursday, Apple denied that it had ever ― or would ever ― “do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.” Still, Apple apologized for what it called a “misunderstanding” and promised it would cut the price of out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacements to $29 from $79 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later model beginning in late January; the company said the service would be available worldwide through December 2018.</P>

<P>在周四的声明中，苹果对它所谓的“误会”致歉，并且承诺将自一月底开始，为拥有iPhone 6或后续型号设备的用户降低质保期外iPhone电池更换的价格，从97美元降低至29美元。该公司说将在全世界范围内提供这项服务，直至2018年12月。</P>

<P>Apple also said it would soon issue a software update with new features that would allow users to more clearly see the health of their iPhone’s battery.</P>

<P>苹果还表示将发布一款带有新功能的软件升级，该升级将允许用户更清楚地看到他们iPhone电池的状态。</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>The Robots Are Coming,and Sweden Is Fine<BR>机器人来了，但瑞典人一点也不怕</P>

<P>GARPENBERG, Sweden ― From inside the control room carved into the rock more than half a mile underground, Mika Persson can see the robots on the march, supposedly coming for his job here at the New Boliden mine.</P>

<P>瑞典加尔彭贝里――从离地面逾半英里（约合800米）的岩石中凿出来的控制室里，米卡・佩尔松(Mika Persson)能看到机器人正在行进。它们据说是来取代他在新博利登矿(New Boliden)的工作。</P>

<P>He’s fine with it.</P>

<P>他对此没有意见。</P>

<P>Sweden’s famously generous social welfare system makes this a place not prone to fretting about automation ― or much else, for that matter.</P>

<P>瑞典的社会福利制度出了名的慷慨，这使得这里的人不大因为自动化而发愁。其他很多东西也一样。</P>

<P>Mr. Persson, 35, sits in front of four computer screens, one displaying the loader he steers as it lifts freshly blasted rock containing silver, zinc and lead. If he were down in the mine shaft operating the loader manually, he would be inhaling dust and exhaust fumes. Instead, he reclines in an office chair while using a joystick to control the machine.</P>

<P>35岁的佩尔松坐在四个电脑屏幕前。其中一个显示的是他操作的那台装载机举起刚被炸开的含银、锌和铅的岩石的画面。如果下到矿井里手工操作装载机，他会吸入灰尘和废气。但现在，他靠在办公椅上，用操纵杆控制着机器。</P>

<P>He is cognizant that robots are evolving by the day. Boliden is testing self-driving vehicles to replace truck drivers. But Mr. Persson assumes people will always be needed to keep the machines running. He has faith in the Swedish economic model and its protections against the torment of joblessness.</P>

<P>他知道，机器人每天都在进化。博利登正在测试取代卡车司机的自动驾驶汽车。但佩尔松认为，总得有人保持机器运转。他对瑞典的经济模式和它让劳动者免受失业之苦的保护措施有信心。</P>

<P>“I’m not really worried,” he says. “There are so many jobs in this mine that even if this job disappears, they will have another one. The company will take care of us.”</P>

<P>“我其实不担心，”他说。“矿上有很多工作，即使这个岗位消失了，他们还会设立新岗位。公司会照顾我们的。”</P>

<P>In much of the world, people whose livelihoods depend on paychecks are increasingly anxious about a potential wave of unemployment threatened by automation. As the frightening tale goes, globalization forced people in wealthier lands like North America and Europe to compete directly with cheaper laborers in Asia and Latin America, sowing joblessness. Now, the robots are coming to finish off the humans.</P>

<P>在世界上的很多地方，靠工资维持生计的人越来越担心自动化可能会带来的潜在失业潮。根据骇人的说法，全球化会迫使北美和欧洲等富裕地区的人与亚洲和拉丁美洲的廉价劳动力直接竞争，导致失业问题。现在，机器人要来毁灭人类了。</P>

<P>But such talk has little currency in Sweden or its Scandinavian neighbors, where unions are powerful, government support is abundant, and trust between employers and employees runs deep. Here, robots are just another way to make companies more efficient. As employers prosper, workers have consistently gained a proportionate slice of the spoils ― a stark contrast to the United States and Britain, where wages have stagnated even while corporate profits have soared.</P>

<P>但在瑞典或它在斯堪的纳维亚半岛上的邻国，这类言论几乎没有什么市场。在这些地方，工会势力强大，政府支持充足，雇主和雇员相互信任。在这里，机器人只是提高公司效率的另一种方式。随着雇主繁荣发展，员工也不断获得相应的好处。这与美国和英国形成了鲜明的对比。在美英两国，尽管企业利润飙升，但工资水平却停滞不前。</P>

<P>“In Sweden, if you ask a union leader, ‘Are you afraid of new technology?’ they will answer, ‘No, I’m afraid of old technology,’” says the Swedish minister for employment and integration, Ylva Johansson. “The jobs disappear, and then we train people for new jobs. We won’t protect jobs. But we will protect workers.”</P>

<P>“在瑞典，如果问工会领袖，‘你害怕新技术吗?’，他们会回答说，‘不怕，我害怕老技术，’”瑞典负责就业和一体化的大臣于尔娃・约翰松(Ylva Johansson)说。“工作岗位消失，然后我们会培训劳动者从事新岗位。我们不会保护工作岗位。但我们会保护劳动者。”</P>

<P>Americans tend to dismiss Nordic countries as a realm of nanny-state-worshiping socialists in contrast to the swashbuckling capitalists who rule in places like Silicon Valley. But Sweden presents the possibility that, in an age of automation, innovation may be best advanced by maintaining ample cushions against failure.</P>

<P>美国人往往对北欧国家不屑一顾，认为那是一个由崇尚保姆式国家的社会主义者，而不是统治硅谷等地的传奇资本主义者构成的国度。但瑞典却展示了一种可能性：在自动化时代，最能推动创新的，也许是保持足够的缓冲应对失败。</P>

<P>“A good safety net is good for entrepreneurship,” says Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. “If a project doesn’t succeed, you don’t have to go broke.”</P>

<P>“完善的安全保障系统有利于创业，”设在斯德哥尔摩的研究机构Futurion的政策主任卡尔・梅林(Carl Melin)说。“如果项目不成功，你也不用破产。”</P>

<P>Eighty percent of Swedes express positive views about robots and artificial intelligence, according to a survey this year by the European Commission. By contrast, a survey by the Pew Research Center found that 72 percent of Americans were “worried” about a future in which robots and computers substitute for humans.</P>

<P>欧盟委员会(European Commission)今年进行的一项调查显示，80%的瑞典人对机器人和人工智能持乐观态度。相比之下，皮尤研究中心(Pew Research Center)的一项调查发现，72%的美国人对机器人和电脑代替人类的未来感到“担忧”。</P>

<P>In the United States, where most people depend on employers for health insurance, losing a job can trigger a descent to catastrophic depths. It makes workers reluctant to leave jobs to forge potentially more lucrative careers. It makes unions inclined to protect jobs above all else.</P>

<P>在美国，大部分人依赖雇主提供医疗保险，失业可能会导致生活水平出现灾难性的下降。这导致劳动者不愿离开工作岗位，去建立可能更赚钱的事业，也让工会倾向于不顾一切地保护工作岗位。</P>

<P>Yet in Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, governments provide health care along with free education. They pay generous unemployment benefits, while employers finance extensive job training programs. Unions generally embrace automation as a competitive advantage that makes jobs more secure.</P>

<P>但在瑞典和斯堪的纳维亚半岛的其他地方，政府提供医疗保健服务和免费的教育。它们会发放高额失业救济金，同时雇主也会出资开展广泛的职业培训。工会往往认为自动化是一种竞争优势，会让工作岗位更安全。</P>

<P>Making the United States more like Scandinavia would entail costs that collide with the tax-cutting fervor that has dominated American politics in recent decades.</P>

<P>让美国更像斯堪的纳维亚半岛，会带来与近几十年来在美国政坛占主导地位的减税热情相矛盾的成本。</P>

<P>Sweden, Denmark and Finland all spend more than 27 percent of their annual economic output on government services to help jobless people and other vulnerable groups, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The United States devotes less than 20 percent of its economy to such programs.</P>

<P>来自经济合作与发展组织(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)的数据显示，瑞典、丹麦和芬兰在帮助失业人员和其他弱势群体的政府服务上的支出，均超过年度经济产出的27%。而美国在这类项目上的投入不到经济产出的20%。</P>

<P>For Swedish businesses, these outlays yield a key dividend: Employees have proved receptive to absorbing new technology.</P>

<P>对瑞典的企业来说，这些支出带来了一个关键的好处：雇员被证明乐于接受新技术。</P>

<P>“If we don’t move forward with the technology and making money, well, then we are out of business,” says Magnus Westerlund, 35, vice chairman of a local union chapter representing laborers at two Boliden mines. “You don’t need a degree in math to do the calculation.”</P>

<P>“如果我们不推进科技进步赚钱，那么，我们就要歇业了，”35岁的马格努斯・韦斯特隆德(Magnus Westerlund)说，他是当地代表着两个博利登矿场劳工工会的副主席。“你不需要数学学位就能算出来。”</P>

<P>At the mine below the frigid pine forests in Garpenberg, 110 miles northwest of Stockholm, Mr. Persson and his co-workers earn about 500,000 krona per year (nearly $60,000). They get five weeks of vacation. Under Swedish law, when a child arrives, the parents have 480 days of family leave to apportion between them. No robot is going to change any of that, Mr. Persson says.</P>

<P>在位于斯德哥尔摩西北110英里（约合177公里）外的加尔彭贝里，寒冷松林下方的矿场里，佩尔松及其同事每年能挣约50万克朗（约6万美元）。他们有五周的假期。根据瑞典法律，在生了孩子后，父母可以分摊480天的家庭假。佩尔松说，任何一个机器人都改变不了这一点。</P>

<P>“It’s a Swedish kind of thinking,” says Erik Lundstrom, a 41-year-old father of two who works alongside Mr. Persson. “If you do something for the company, the company gives something back.”</P>

<P>“这是瑞典的思维逻辑，”41岁的埃里克・伦德斯特伦斯(Erik Lundstrom)说，他是两个孩子的父亲，与佩尔松一起工作。“如果你为公司做了事，公司也要回报你点儿东西。”</P>

<P>That proposition now confronts a formidable test. No one knows how many jobs are threatened by robots and other forms of automation, but projections suggest a potential shock.</P>

<P>这一主张如今面临着严峻考验。没人知道有多少工作处在机器人或其他形式自动化的威胁之下，但预测显示，那是一个潜在的震惊点。</P>

<P>A 2016 study by the World Economic Forum surveyed 15 major economies that collectively hold two-thirds of the global work force ― about 1.86 billion workers ― concluding that the rise of robots and artificial intelligence will destroy a net 5.1 million jobs by 2020.</P>

<P>2016年，世界经济论坛(World Economic Forum)对15个国家进行了问卷调查，这些国家共计占全球劳动力――约18.6亿工人――的三分之二，并且得出结论，认为机器人和人工智能的崛起将在2020年毁掉510万个工作岗位。</P>

<P>A pair of Oxford University researchers concluded that nearly half of all American jobs could be replaced by robots and other forms of automation over the next two decades.</P>

<P>两位牛津大学(Oxford University)的研究人员认为，美国所有工作岗位近半数都可以在未来20年，被机器人及其他形式的自动化代替。</P>

<P>When automated teller machines first landed at bank branches in the late 1960s, some foresaw the extinction of humans working in banks. But employment swelled as banks invested the savings into new areas like mortgage lending and insurance. Similar trends may play out again.</P>

<P>当自动柜员机在1960年代末首次出现在银行分支机构时，一些人预测银行的人类工作会消失。但随着银行将储蓄投资到了抵押贷款和保险这样的新领域里，被雇佣的人数大大增加。类似情形可能还会再次出现。</P>

<P>Yet even if robots create more jobs than they eliminate, large numbers of people are going to need to pursue new careers.</P>

<P>然而即使是机器人创造的工作要远多于它们消灭的工作，仍有大批人会需要追求新的事业。</P>

<P>Sweden and its Nordic brethren have proved successful at managing such transitions. So-called job security councils financed by employers help people who lose jobs find new ones.</P>

<P>在应对此类过渡方面，瑞典及其北欧同胞已经证明自己取得了成功。由雇主提供资金的工作保障委员会会帮助那些失业的人找到新的工作。</P>

<P>Maintaining Sweden’s social safety net also requires that the public continue to pay tax rates approaching 60 percent. Yet as Sweden absorbs large numbers of immigrants from conflict-torn nations, that support may wane. Many lack education and may be difficult to employ. If large numbers wind up depending on government largess, a backlash could result.</P>

<P>瑞典社会保障体系的维持，同样也要求公众继续缴纳接近60%的税率。然而随着瑞典接收了大量来自冲突不断国家的移民，这种支持可能会日渐减退。许多人缺乏教育，可能很难受到雇佣。如果大量移民最后依靠政府慷慨解囊度日，可能会导致出现反弹。</P>

<P>“There’s a risk that the social contract could crack,” said Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm.</P>

<P>“存在社会契约破裂的风险，”斯德哥尔摩工业经济研究所(Industrial Economics)的经济学家马滕・布利克斯(Marten Blix)说。</P>

<P>For now, the social compact endures, and at the Boliden mine, a sense of calm prevails.</P>

<P>就目前而言，社会契约还维持着。在博利登矿场，气氛平静。</P>

<font size="7" face="arial">

<P>Rupert Murdoch and President Trump: A Friendship of Convenience<BR>权力与利益：默多克如何成为特朗普的亲密心腹</P>

<P>The calls to the White House come at least once a week. “Murdoch here,” the blunt, accented voice on the other end of the line says.</P>

<P>打给白宫的电话至少一周一次。“我默多克，”电话另一头传来一个突兀的、带口音的声音。</P>

<P>For decades, Rupert Murdoch has used his media properties to establish a direct line to Australian and British leaders. But in the 44 years since he bought his first newspaper in the U.S., he has largely failed to cultivate close ties to an American president. Until now.</P>

<P>几十年来，鲁伯特・默多克(Rupert Murdoch)利用自己的媒体产业建立起了与澳大利亚和英国领导人的直线联系。但在美国买下第一份报纸后的44年里，他在很大程度上未能与美国总统建立密切的联系。现在不同了。</P>

<P>Murdoch and President Donald Trump ― both forged in New York’s tabloid culture, one as the owner of The New York Post, the other as its perfect subject ― have traveled in the same circles since the 1970s, but they did not become close until recently, when their interests began to align more than ever before.</P>

<P>自70年代以来，默多克和唐纳德・特朗普总统――都经过了纽约小报文化的锻炼，一个是《纽约邮报》(The New York Post)的老板，一个是它完美的报道对象――在相同的圈子里游走，但直到最近两人的利益变得比以前任何时候都更加一致时，他们才变得亲密起来。</P>

<P>Since Inauguration Day, Murdoch has talked regularly with Trump, often bypassing the White House chief of staff, Gen. John F. Kelly, who screens incoming calls. Murdoch has felt comfortable enough to offer counsel that others may shy away from, such as urging the president to stop tweeting and advising him to improve his relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Murdoch also has weekly conversations with Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.</P>

<P>自就职日起，默多克一直和特朗普保持着频繁的联系，常常要绕过筛查来电的白宫幕僚长约翰・F・凯利(John F. Kelly)。默多克已经感觉良好到敢于提出其他人可能会有顾忌的建议，比如劝总统停止发推文，并建议他改善与国务卿雷克斯・蒂勒森(Rex Tillerson)的关系。默多克还与特朗普的女婿兼高级顾问贾里德・库什纳(Jared Kushner)保持着一周一次的交谈。</P>

<P>Before the news broke that Murdoch had agreed to sell vast parts of his 21st Century Fox to the Walt Disney Co. for $52.4 billion, Trump called him to get his assurance that the Fox News Channel, the highly rated cable network and frequent bullhorn of the Trump agenda, would not be affected.</P>

<P>默多克此前同意以524亿美元（约合3400亿元人民币）的价格将自己持有的21世纪福克斯公司(21st Century Fox)股份的很大一部分出售给华特迪士尼公司(Walt Disney Co.)，消息传出前，特朗普来电要求得到他的保证，有着高收视率、经常为特朗普的议程做宣传的有线电视台福克斯新闻频道(Fox News Channel)，在该交易中不会受到影响。</P>

<P>On Dec. 14, the day the agreement was announced, Trump let the world know that he had made a congratulatory call to Murdoch. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, also passed along the president’s belief that the deal would be “a great thing” for jobs ― a claim disputed by Wall Street analysts.</P>

<P>在协议公布的12月14日，特朗普向全世界表示，他已致电默多克表示祝贺。白宫新闻发言人萨拉・哈克比・桑德斯(Sarah Huckabee Sanders)也传达了总统的看法，认为这项协议对就业来说是“一件好事”。但这个说法遭到了华尔街分析师的质疑。</P>

<P>After decades of ups and downs, Trump now counts Murdoch as one of his closest confidants. The two titans made a show of their improved relationship in June 2016, when Murdoch visited Trump at the Trump International Golf Links Scotland before a group of reporters. They appeared together again at a black-tie dinner in May in honor of American and Australian veterans who fought side by side in World War II. Murdoch introduced the president as “my friend Donald J. Trump” before they engaged in a brief hug.</P>

<P>经历了几十年的兴衰起伏后，特朗普现在视默多克为他最亲密的心腹之一。2016年6月，这两大巨头向外界展示了两人关系的改善。当着一群记者的面，默多克前往苏格兰特朗普国际高尔夫球场(Trump International Golf Links)看望特朗普。今年5月，在一场纪念在二战中并肩作战的美国和澳大利亚老兵的正式晚宴上，两人再度一起现身。默多克在介绍特朗普总统时称其是“我的朋友唐纳德・J・特朗普”，之后两人短暂拥抱。</P>

<P>They are opposites in personal style, with Murdoch gruff and low-key, preferring schlubby newsrooms to Trump’s gilded towers and glitz. But they have much in common.</P>

<P>他们的个人风格截然相反。默多克粗暴而低调，更喜欢凌乱的新闻编辑室，而不是特朗普的镀金高楼大厦和浮华。但两人有很多共同之处。</P>

<P>Both were born to wealth, but at a distance from the centers of power. Trump grew up in Jamaica, Queens, the son of a real estate developer content to earn his fortune in the boroughs outside Manhattan ― so close but so far from glittering Midtown, where the son would make his name and his home. Murdoch, the son of a journalist who became the owner of a newspaper chain, spent his childhood in Melbourne, Australia. Murdoch, 86, and Trump, 71, are also alike in that they were both sent to military schools as boys before going on to outdo their fathers in the family businesses.</P>

<P>两人天生富有，但离权力中心都有一段距离。特朗普在皇后区的牙买加长大，父亲是一名房地产开发商，安于在曼哈顿以外的城区攫取财富，距离光鲜的中城――他的儿子日后扬名立万的地方――近在咫尺，却又远在天涯。默多克在澳大利亚墨尔本度过了自己的童年，父亲是一名记者，后来成了一家报纸连锁的老板。现年86岁的默多克和71岁的特朗普还有一个共同点是，两人都曾被送进军校，后在家族企业中超越了自己的父亲。</P>

<P>Although both men parlayed their inheritances into global power, they have stubbornly viewed themselves as outsiders at odds with the establishment. When Murdoch entered the British newspaper market in 1968, London society shunned him and his vulgar tabloids, The Sun and The News of the World, which he used to wound his enemies and advance his political interests. Trump withstood a similar wariness among the elite after he made himself a Manhattan player through his brazen deal making and hucksterism.</P>

<P>两人都是将世袭的财富增值成了全方位的实力，但他们仍固执地将自己视为与体制对抗的外来者。当默多克在1968年进入英国报业市场时，伦敦的上流社会对他以及他用来伤害敌人、提高自身政治利益的低俗小报《太阳报》(The Sun)和《世界新闻报》(The News of the World)冷眼相待。而特朗普在通过不择手段地做生意和营销成在曼哈顿占据一席之地后，精英阶层对他也有过类似的怀疑。</P>

<P>To make their way upward in New York, both men relied on a powerful friend, lawyer Roy M. Cohn, a ruthless fixer who made his name in the 1950s as the chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy, the Red-baiting senator, before representing some of the city’s most powerful figures, including the mobster John Gotti and the New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.</P>

<P>为了在纽约爬得更高，两人都依靠过一个有权势的朋友，律师罗伊・M・科恩(Roy M. Cohn)。这位冷酷无情的操盘手在50年代以反共参议员约瑟夫・麦卡锡(Sen. Joseph McCarthy)的首席法律顾问身份成名，随后又代表了纽约一些最有权势的人物，包括黑帮大佬约翰・高提(John Gotti)以及纽约洋基队的老板乔治・史坦布瑞纳(George Steinbrenner)。</P>

<P>Cohn connected Trump to Murdoch and the tabloid he bought in 1976, The New York Post. The upstart developer saw that he could benefit from the brash daily ― especially its Page Six gossip column, which started a year after Murdoch became the paper’s owner.</P>

<P>科恩将特朗普与默多克以及他在1976年买下的小报《纽约邮报》撮合在了一起。作为一名刚刚发迹的开发商，特朗普看到这份低俗日报能给他带来的益处――尤其是它在被默多克买下一年后开创的“第六版”绯闻专栏。</P>

<P>Trump’s enthusiastic response to the planned Disney-Fox megadeal may have been lost in the swirl of Washington news had it not been for his vehement opposition to another recent attempt at media consolidation ― AT&amp;T’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, a frequent target of the president’s “fake news” complaints. While so far making no move on the Disney-Fox plan, the Justice Department has sued to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal on antitrust grounds in a rare instance of governmental interference in a merger of two companies that do not directly compete with each other.</P>

<P>若不是因为他对近来另一起媒体并购尝试――AT&amp;T提出要以854亿美元收购常常被特朗普控诉为“假新闻”的CNN的母公司时代华纳(Time Warner)――的强烈反对，特朗普对迪士尼-福克斯大交易的盛赞，或许早就被淹没在了华盛顿新闻的漩涡之中。司法部目前对迪士尼-福克斯计划还没有什么举措，但它以反垄断为由提起诉讼，以求阻止AT&amp;T-时代华纳的交易。政府很少出面干预两家并无直接竞争关系的公司的并购案。</P>

<P>Murdoch, whose ideology is more malleable than his critics realize, has long gained from his knack for placing himself close to power. In the 1980s, when he was cozy with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, his London tabloids took a pro-Tory stance. In 1997, his newspapers endorsed the Labor Party leader Tony Blair for prime minister.</P>

<P>而在意识形态上，默多克并不像他的批评者以为的那样不思变通，实际上一直都在靠与权贵拉近关系谋取利益。在80年代，当他与玛格丽特・撒切尔(Margaret Thatcher)首相关系亲近时，他的伦敦小报选择了亲托利党的立场。1997年时，他的报纸又支持工党领袖托尼・布莱尔(Tony Blair)担任首相。</P>

<P>Before the recent rapprochement, Murdoch privately called Trump “phony,” and accused him of exaggerating his net worth. For his part, Trump once threatened to sue Murdoch for libel after The Post reported that the storied Maidstone Club in East Hampton, New York, had denied him membership.</P>

<P>在最近的和解之前，默多克私底下曾称特朗普为“假货”，并谴责他夸大了自己的资产净值。而在《纽约邮报》报道了纽约东汉普顿大名鼎鼎的梅德斯通俱乐部(Maidstone Club)拒绝给特朗普会员资格之后，特朗普也曾一度威胁要起诉默多克诽谤。</P>

<P>During much of the 2016 presidential campaign, Murdoch ― who initially swooned over Jeb Bush ― stood against Trump, declaring on Twitter that he was “embarrassing his friends” and “the whole country.” The Wall Street Journal, Murdoch’s crown jewel, ran an editorial calling the candidate a “catastrophe.” The Post led with the headline “Don Voyage” and declared, “Trump is toast.”</P>

<P>在2016年总统竞选期间，默多克――起初他一心支持杰布・布什(Jeb Bush)――大多数时候都在反对特朗普，在Twitter上宣称特朗普是在让“全国上下”和“他的朋友们丢脸”。默多克的王牌媒体《华尔街日报》发表社论称这位候选人是一个“大灾难”。《纽约邮报》则以“唐纳德一路走好”为标题宣告“特朗普完蛋了”。</P>

<P>Trump shot back on Twitter: “Wow, I have always liked the @nypost but they have really lied when they covered me in Iowa.” He also went after the Journal: “Look how small the pages have become @WSJ,” he wrote. “Looks like a tabloid ― saving money I assume!”</P>

<P>特朗普在Twitter上回击道：“哇，我一直都喜欢纽邮，但他们对我在艾奥瓦州的报道的确是在撒谎。”他也对《华尔街日报》穷追不舍：“看看这些版面变得多小@WSJ，”他写道。“看着就像个小报――是在省钱吧我猜！”</P>

<P>The Post ended up endorsing Trump, with reservations, in the New York primary, but refrained from endorsing either him or Hillary Clinton in the general election.</P>

<P>《纽约邮报》在纽约州的初选中最后又有所保留地转为支持特朗普，但在大选中既没支持特朗普也没支持希拉里・克林顿(Hillary Clinton)。</P>

<P>More recently, Murdoch expressed exasperation with Trump’s immigration policies. In response to the White House ban on travel of people from majority-Muslim nations, his company, 21st Century Fox, released a memo offering assistance to any employees hurt by the executive order and reminding them that “21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U.S., founded by ― and comprising at all levels of the business ― immigrants.” In August, James Murdoch, the younger son of Murdoch and the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, condemned the president’s response to the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia.</P>

<P>前段时间默多克对特朗普的移民政策表现出了愤怒。白宫发布禁令禁止来自以穆斯林为主的国家的人入境后，默多克的公司――21世纪福克斯公司(21st Century Fox)――发布了一份备忘录作为回应，向所有受到该政令影响的员工提供帮助，并提醒他们，“21世纪福克斯公司是一个全球化的公司，为总部设在美国而自豪，这个公司由移民建立，企业的各个层面都包含了移民。”八月，詹姆斯・默多克(James Murdoch)――21世纪福克斯公司的首席执行官、默多克的小儿子――谴责了总统对弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔骚乱的反应。</P>

<P>The man partly responsible for the détente was another moneyed outsider who craved status and respect: Jared Kushner.</P>

<P>还有另一个渴望地位和尊重的富有局外者，也在一定程度上促进了关系的缓和：贾里德・库什纳(Jared Kushner)。</P>

<P>When Kushner bought The New York Observer in 2006, he wasted little time reaching out to Murdoch. “He wanted to be Murdoch,” said one person close to both men at the time. In early 2016, after a presidential debate during which Trump faced aggressive questioning from Megyn Kelly, then a Fox News anchor, the candidate sent Kushner to Murdoch on a media diplomacy mission.</P>

<P>2006年买下《纽约观察家》(New York Observer)后，库什纳迅速与默多克取得了接触。“他想成为默多克，”一位当时与两人都很亲近的人表示。2016年初，特朗普在一场总统竞选辩论上遭到时任福克斯新闻主播梅根・凯利(Megyn Kelly)的激烈质疑，随后特朗普派库什纳去和默多克见面，展开了一场媒体外交。</P>

<P>Kushner’s wife, Ivanka Trump, is close friends with Murdoch’s third wife, Wendi Deng. Murdoch and Deng attended the Kushner-Trump wedding in 2009 at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and the Murdoch daughters, Grace and Chloe, served as flower girls.</P>

<P>库什纳的妻子伊万卡・特朗普(Ivanka Trump)是默多克第三任妻子邓文迪的密友。2009年，默多克和邓文迪曾前往新泽西州贝德明斯特的特朗普全国高尔夫俱乐部(Trump National Golf Club)参加贾里德・库什纳和伊万卡・特朗普的婚礼。默多克的女儿格雷丝(Grace)和克洛依(Chloe)担任花童。</P>

<P>Before Murdoch and Deng divorced in 2013, Kushner and Ivanka Trump vacationed on Rosehearty, Murdoch’s 184-foot sailing yacht. In a further sign of the two families’ closeness, Ivanka Trump took on the job of Murdoch trustee responsible for overseeing the two girls’ $300 million fortune ― a role she gave up a month before her father took office.</P>

<P>在2013年默多克和邓文迪离婚前，库什纳和伊万卡会去默多克的那艘184英尺长的游艇罗斯哈蒂号(Rosehearty)上度假。更加彰显两家关系之亲密的是，伊万卡・特朗普曾受托于默多克，负责监管两个女孩的3亿美元财富――她在父亲就任总统一个月前放弃了这一职位。</P>

<P>Murdoch arrived with former model Jerry Hall, his fourth wife, whom he married in March. Under cloudy skies, the newlyweds toured the property in a golf cart large enough for four. Trump was at the wheel, with Hall seated beside him. Murdoch, wearing sunglasses, sat on a backward-facing rumble seat as they made their way to the Trump-refurbished Macleod House, a 15th-century mansion, where they had dinner.</P>

<P>默多克和三月结婚的第四任妻子、前模特杰里・霍尔(Jerry Hall)一同抵达球场。在多云的天空下，新婚夫妇乘坐一辆可容纳4人的高尔夫球车游览了这个场地。特朗普把着方向盘，他的身边坐着霍尔，戴着墨镜的默多克坐在面朝后的后座，一行前往由特朗普翻修过的15世纪大宅麦克劳府(MacLeod House)共进晚餐。</P>

<P>Trump’s mended relationship with Murdoch has not gone unnoticed by Time Warner executives, who wonder why AT&amp;T’s attempt to buy the company has run into regulatory trouble at a time when the president has smiled on the Disney-Fox deal.</P>

<P>时代华纳的高层也注意到了特朗普与默多克关系的改善。他们在想，为什么AT&amp;T收购时代华纳的尝试会遇到监管问题，与此同时总统对迪士尼-福克斯交易却表示认可。</P>

<P>“If you look at the facts of our case, even before you heard the administration’s endorsement of the Disney-Fox deal, it was hard to understand how the Justice Department could reach a decision to block our deal,” Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said.</P>

<P>“从我们这一案的事实来看，就算你还没有听闻政府对迪士尼-福克斯交易的支持，都很难理解司法部怎么会阻止我们的交易，”时代华纳的首席执行官杰弗里・L・比克斯(Jeffrey L. Bewkes)说道。</P>

<P>A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, said that Trump hadn’t spoken to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal and that “no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter.”</P>

<P>白宫发言人拉吉・沙阿(Raj Shah)表示，特朗普未与司法部长杰夫・塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)谈及有关AT&amp;T-时代华纳的交易，并且“没有哪位白宫官员曾获得与司法部讨论此事的授权。”</P>

<P>Didi Chuxing, a Chinese Rival to Uber, Raises $4 Billion<BR>滴滴出行获新一轮40亿美元融资</P>

<P>China’s answer to Uber is catching up with its American rival in a key metric: money.</P>

<P>一家堪称与优步(Uber)相当的中国公司，正在资金这个关键指标上赶超其美国竞争对手。</P>

<P>Didi Chuxing received $4 billion in new funding from investors that include SoftBank of Japan and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi state fund, according to a person familiar with the investment.</P>

<P>据一位知情人士透露，滴滴出行从包括日本软银(SoftBank)和阿布扎比政府基金穆巴达拉(Mubadala)在内的投资者那里获得了40亿美元的新融资。</P>

<P>With the latest investment, Didi Chuxing’s valuation has been increased to $56 billion, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the details publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. That is up significantly from April, when it was valued at about $50 billion after a $5.5 billion fund-raising round that also included SoftBank.</P>

<P>根据该知情人士，这轮最新融资让滴滴出行的估值增至560亿美元。此人未被授权公开讨论有关细节，也不愿透露姓名。新估值比滴滴今年4月份的估值高了不少，那是在滴滴从也包括软银在内投资者那里融到了55亿美元资金之后，当时公司的估值约为500亿美元。</P>

<P>By contrast, Uber was valued at $70 billion after its last round of fund-raising.</P>

<P>与之相比，优步在最近一轮融资后的估值为700亿美元。</P>

<P>Neither Didi Chuxing nor Uber are publicly traded companies. Their minimal financial disclosures make it difficult to determine whether the valuation figures would be supported by the broader market. SoftBank has been angling to make an investment in Uber that would value that company at far less, for example.</P>

<P>滴滴出行和优步都不是上市公司。它们只披露非常有限的财务信息，让人难以确定这些估值是否有更广泛的市场支持。比如，软银一直想用比优步估值低得多的报价购买其股权。</P>

<P>Still, the latest funding round for Didi Chuxing shows how capital continues to rush into the global ride-hailing market, where deep-pocketed investors are jockeying to place bets on companies that they believe will continue to transform the way people get around.</P>

<P>不过，滴滴出行的最新一轮融资显示了资本在怎样继续涌入全球网约车市场。财力雄厚的投资者正在这个市场上竞相把赌注押在那些他们认为会继续改变人们出行方式的公司身上。</P>

<P>Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s business in China last year after years of fierce competition, said in a statement on Thursday that the funding would help it invest further in artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies. The new funds will also assist in overseas expansion efforts, the company said. Didi Chuxing recently said it was looking to bring its services to Taiwan, with the help of a local partner.</P>

<P>滴滴出行周四在一份声明中说，这轮融资将帮助公司在人工智能和其他先进技术方面做进一步的投入。在经过多年激烈竞争之后，滴滴在去年收购了优步在中国的业务。公司说，新融资还将帮助其海外扩张努力。滴滴出行最近表示，希望与在家当地合作伙伴的帮助下，将服务拓展到台湾。</P>

<P>SoftBank’s investment in Didi Chuxing marks its latest bet on ride-hailing. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s leader, has been making significant investments in companies that collect enormous quantities of data and that are therefore likely to underpin future, technology-led transformations in everything from food to finance. Apart from Didi Chuxing, SoftBank has also invested in a number of Uber’s direct competitors around the world, including Grab in Southeast Asia and Ola in India.</P>

<P>软银对滴滴出行的投资标志着该公司对网约车市场押下的最新赌注。软银领导人孙正义(Masayoshi Son)一直在大笔投资那些能收集到海量数据的公司，这些公司很可能会支撑从食品到金融等所有行业未来以技术为主导的转型。除了滴滴出行，软银还投资了优步在全球的几家直接竞争对手，包括东南亚的Grab和印度的Ola。</P>

<P>Ever since it edged Uber out of the Chinese market, Didi Chuxing ― which already counts technology heavyweights like Apple and China’s two biggest internet companies, the Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, as backers ― has set its sights on developing next-generation technologies and pushing into new markets. This year, the company opened a lab in Silicon Valley that focuses on artificial-intelligence-based security and driverless-car technologies.</P>

<P>自从把优步挤出中国市场以后，滴滴出行就把目光投向了开发下一代技术和开拓新市场上。滴滴的支持者包括苹果(Apple)，以及中国两大互联网公司阿里巴巴集团和腾讯控股这样的技术巨头。今年，滴滴在硅谷建立了一个重点研究基于人工智能的安全性和无人驾驶技术的实验室。</P>
